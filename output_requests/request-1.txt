<p class="block_2">Hello, this is Phantaminum and Beloved (of WCT fame). This is a continuation of a project that aims to standardize nomenclature and formatting, while dividing Web Novel chapters in the same way the Light Novel does. Colored illustrations have also been added where possible for maximum enjoyment. You may find a list of all volumes I have already finished, or plan to work on, at the <a class="text_" href="index_split_031.html#id_Toc172476629">final chapter of this document</a>.</p>
<p class="block_2"><span class="text_">This document is a compilation of Re: Zero Web Novel chapters that correspond to Volume 37, spanning Web Novel Arc 8 Chapters 61 to 74, and Curtain’s Close.</span> <b class="calibre1">Witch Cult Translations</b> (<a class="text_" href="https://witchculttranslation.com/arc-7/">website</a>)<b class="calibre1">,</b> was used as a source of the translations for all the Chapters. Chapters 62 and 72, as well as parts of Chapters 61, 63, 65 to 68, 70, 72 to 74 and Curtain’s Close were produced with the use of Machine Translation tools.</p>
<p class="block_2">For the sake of completeness, I leave you with the same wall of text detailing what I did using the available translations. Feel free to skip it if you don’t care/have already read it.</p>
<p class="block_2">The original translations have been proofread, edited and reformatted by myself, on top of whatever original editing and proofreading work was done by Witch Cult Translations. This means that the formatting should remain consistent no matter which source is used.</p>
<p class="block_2">I have tried to follow naming conventions present in the Light Novel as much as possible, only diverging when community-given names differed greatly. I have also tried to conserve as many of the original translator notes by Witch Cult Translations as much as possible.</p>
<p class="block_2">As a fun quirk, I have done something which I admit is probably not consensual: to flip the languages whenever someone speaks what is colloquially coined as Engrish. This means, that in the case where the story uses English, where possible, Japanese will be written as Romaji (Japanese in Latin script). When this happens, a note was added with the original expression (and its translation), and the new expression that was converted to Romaji. Basically, I made everyone using Engrish look like weeaboos.</p>
<p class="block_2">I hope you enjoy this as much as I did. If you have anything to point out, I’m often lurking in pretty much every Re: Zero discussion site, be it the Reddit Discord Server, the Subreddit, or 4chan’s /a/ board. Alternatively, feel free to use <a class="text_" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LFiWfytWZv0tHWGCEJ8l7Wvo-WI3cE0pVgT1uhtITdI/edit?usp=sharing">this document</a> to suggest corrections or other changes.</p>
<p class="block_3" id="calibre_pb_1">P.S.: Much thanks to Joy Kirbs from Discord for aiding me in redesigning the covers.</p>
