<p class="block_12">△▼△▼△▼△</p>
<p class="block_2">――Lightning, had cut through starlight.</p>
<p class="block_2">There was no other appropriate expression to describe what had come to pass.</p>
<p class="block_2">Only, the moment in which he bore witness to the events unfolding before him, the only question he had to ponder was whether or not he could believe that what he had seen was actually real.</p>
<p class="block_2">However――</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “No matter how fucking absurd it may be…!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus Segmunt had slayed the star.</p>
<p class="block_2">In the likeness of the Witch of Greed, the one behind the curtain who had employed a forbidden magic that was a specialty of that same Witch, was now wide-eyed at the same reality Al had witnessed.</p>
<p class="block_2">It was no easy feat to make a star fall.</p>
<p class="block_2">Even the real Witch of Greed had said that she would not want to make more than one fall in the span of a day.</p>
<p class="block_2">In other words, she could not fire more in succession.</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “OHHH――!!”</p>
<p class="block_2">In a world where the light of the sundered star painted the sky white, and where even all semblance of sound had vanished, Al raised his voice to rouse his own spirits, making his approach towards the midst of the sky using stone pillars that he was creating as footholds.</p>
<p class="block_2">A star had fallen, said star had been slain, and thus, approaching the Witch who had ceased her movement in surprise――</p>
<p class="block_2">Witch: “It is true that I was surprised. However――”</p>
<p class="block_2">The stone <i class="calibre4">dao</i> which Al had thrusted forth as he lunged, was crushed in the palm of the Witch. The wind enshrouding that palm had vibrated immensely, a combination of magic and martial arts capable of shattering its target.</p>
<p class="block_2">If a direct hit had been made, the magical technique would have shredded flesh, bone, and everything else into pieces.</p>
<p class="block_2">With it still within her grasp, the Witch attempted to smash Al’s head along with his helmet.</p>
<p class="block_2">The Witch had updated her threat assessment concerning Cecilus, who had unleashed a stroke of sword that was far too extraordinary, and she corrected her perception of Al as an obstacle to killing Arakiya, regarding him as a pebble that ought to be eliminated quickly.</p>
<p class="block_2">But, she was not aware―― Even a pebble could sometimes kill the one who stumbled over it.</p>
<p class="block_2">Witch: “Innovation: Was Requi――”</p>
<p class="block_2">A moment later, the Witch’s head was struck by Al’s left arm―― an improvised prosthetic arm constructed of rock and stone.</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “――Your stars were bad.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Witch: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">As Al slightly altered the connotation of his habitual words, the Witch’s eyes trembled.</p>
<p class="block_2">It was the instant she was maneuvering to attempt some manner of counterattack or countermeasure―― Before Al, who had already completed all his preparations, that instant felt like it was as distant as an eternity.</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “――Ol Shamak.”</p>
<p class="block_2">In response to the incantation spun by Al’s lips from within his iron helmet, the world transformed.</p>
<p class="block_2">Basking in the unthinkable attack, the Witch, who had become unable to think for an instant, had her whole body entangled, preventing her from moving her body, and halting the activity of the Gate within her body.</p>
<p class="block_2">This was an anti-Witch trump card that Al had acquired.</p>
<p class="block_2">Witch: “――Ah.”</p>
<p class="block_2">The Witch fell to the ground with a weak exhale, having lost her freedom.</p>
<p class="block_2">Constrained by a power that ought to be called by the contradictory expression of black light, her form resembled the chrysalis of an insect. As a matter of fact, the degree to which her movements had hardened was also to that extent―― Just as had been done unto the most terrifying Witch in the world.</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “But, with this… <i class="calibre4">Blurgh</i>.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al landed beside the fallen Witch and attempted to look up, but he was struck by a sense of lethargy as he fell to his knees and vomited on the spot.</p>
<p class="block_2">His improvised left arm had already collapsed. He quickly lifted the chin of his helmet with his right hand, and his whole body creaked from the enormous exhaustion as he vomited yellow gastric juice from his exposed mouth.</p>
<p class="block_2">Pounding, intense pain shot through his head, and his vision completely blacked out.</p>
<p class="block_2">From this sensation, he knew his eyesight would not return for a while. Though, there was solace now that he had already finished restraining the Witch――</p>
<p class="block_2">Witch: “――Correction: Required.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Ah?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Gasping for breath with the edges of his mouth stained by gastric drool, Al looked up.</p>
<p class="block_2">Even when turned upward, his vision remained dark; however, he turned his head toward the sound of the voice and exhibited doubt.</p>
<p class="block_2">What, had the Witch just said?</p>
<p class="block_2">Her Gate having been forcibly closed, the Witch ought to have been unable to knead her magic, so just what――</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “What?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al, whose vision was occluded, was unable to tell―― The entirety of the Crystal Palace, located in the northernmost part of the Imperial Capital, renowned as the most beautiful castle in the world, began to glow faintly.</p>
<p class="block_12">△▼△▼△▼△</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">The Crystal Palace flickered, and the ultimate weapon of the Imperial Capital of Lupugana, the Magic Crystal Cannon, was fired.</p>
<p class="block_2">It had been unleashed once during the Imperial Civil War, when the living were contending for the throne, just before the Great Disaster had posed a threat to the entire Empire. Capable of even causing maps to be redrawn, it was a weapon that transcended human capability.</p>
<p class="block_2">That the target was themselves―― no, it was aimed at the Witch who had transformed into a black mass on the ground, a fact that was, as expected, immediately noticed by Cecilus Segment.</p>
<p class="block_2">It was a suicide bomb tactic designed to lock on to the Witch herself, ensuring that the target would be eliminated―― the person who had come up with it would be a genius at harassment, and this was surely the work of an evil and cunning villain.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “Masayume.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Confirming the sensation of the Enchanted Sword in his hand, Cecilus, immediately after slaying the star, attempted to push himself even further.</p>
<p class="block_2">Al, who had achieved a surprising victory such that giving him any more spotlight would have been excessive; the sleeping heroine behind him who, if left unprotected, would cause things to no longer make rational sense in storytelling and leading actor terms; and vaguely fueled by his father’s death, the revival of Perfect Cecilus―― needless to say, he was spurred on by it all.</p>
<p class="block_2">The star, and the subsequent firing of the imperial treasure, facing off against it, he himself was the Blue Lightning―― and, it was at that moment.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">With one foot raised as he was about to step forth, Cecilus’s blue eyes widened.</p>
<p class="block_2">Then, with an abrupt sigh, he lowered his raised foot to the ground. Lowering it, and shaking his head as if to say “Good grief”――</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “――Al Shamak!!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Mere moments before the light of the Magic Crystal Cannon would have arrived, a loud voice reverberated across the skies of the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p class="block_2">Immediately after, the color of the sky, which had been dyed red and white as it pleased, was engulfed in black, and a bottomless void that could swallow even light had been opened in the heavenly skies.</p>
<p class="block_2">It was a supremely thrilling and flashy interruption that had completely wrecked the Witch’s plan to snatch victory by sacrificing herself at this juncture, and the ones who had brought it about were――</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “About time you showed up or you’d have lost your chance to shine, Boss.”</p>
<p class="block_2">The great void in the sky had swallowed up the light, and catching sight of the tiny figures that had created it, Cecilus smiled at the black-haired boy and the girl in the dress who were holding hands.</p>
<p class="block_2">Seemingly not having heard the voice of the smiling Cecilus, the boy shouted.</p>
<p class="block_2">Boy: “Like I’d ever let you! ――Bring it on, oh inevitable fate!!”</p>
