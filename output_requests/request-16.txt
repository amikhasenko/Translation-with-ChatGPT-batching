<p class="block_2">If the question was regarding the reason why they had individually looked up at the sky, there were likely many who could explain themselves. Those with keen senses may have perceived a strong undulation of Mana, and those with good hearing would have heard the loud neigh of a flying dragon. Likewise were those with a focus on the origin of the Magic Crystal Cannon, having been fired a moment prior, and those moving with the Palace as their destination.</p>
<p class="block_2">But, even if they could all provide explanations for themselves, they could not explain the reason for everybody having done so.</p>
<p class="block_2">If it could be done, then it was only by the leading actor who decided the logic of the world within himself, and if he were to be asked, then his answer would be plain and simple――</p>

<p class="block_2">――By leaps and bounds, leaps and bounds, a dazzlingly radiant streak of green light drew a line towards the sky directly above the Crystal Palace.</p>
<p class="block_2">Pulling inwards, pulling inwards, before anyone could realize it, all the clouds present in the sky above the Imperial Capital had been congregated into an enormous sea of clouds, and plunging right into the midst of it――</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">――That instant, as if the sky itself was aglow, a flicker of light suddenly illuminated the world in dazzling scintillation.</p>
