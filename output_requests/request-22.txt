<p class="block_2">And that was because――</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “――Priscilla-sama?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem muttered to herself as she felt the heat of the painless flame in her eye.</p>
<p class="block_2">Unsure. Rem was not even sure why. But, Rem followed her heart and was certain of who it was that had brought about that flame.</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “Katya-san.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Katya: “W-what is this!? Water… where’s some water!? Quick, quick, I need some water to put this out…!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “No, I don’t think this is a fire that should be put out. Besides.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Katya: “Besides?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Before the flustered and confused Katya, Rem stood up and found her overturned, barely damaged wheelchair, lifted Katya into it, and sat her down. </p>
<p class="block_2">Then, she looked at the people in the relief station who were standing up, and nodded.</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “I feel like I’m being told something―― That, we’ve got to hang on just a bit further.”</p>
<p class="block_12">△▼△▼△▼△</p>
<p class="block_2">――The water mirror shattered, and the crimson woman descended from the sky in a spray of droplets.</p>
<p class="block_2">All were transfixed by her overwhelming presence, looking up at the sky as if being bathed by the setting sun.</p>
<p class="block_2">And, of course, that held true for the Witch as well.</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “――Priscilla Barielle!” </p>
<p class="block_2">At this moment, after deconstructing the Magic Crystals with the activation of the incomplete magic circle, there were forty-four Witches that Sphinx had manifested by absorbing some of the vast amount of Mana.</p>
<p class="block_2">Each of them turned their palms toward the sky, and light appeared around the descending Priscilla. But――</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “Don’t look away and don’t touch the dancing lady!”</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “I dunno about that, bad move that.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Not missing this opportunity, the transcendent beings interfered, reducing the number from forty-four to thirty-six in one fell swoop.</p>
<p class="block_2">Despite that, the balls of light, more than enough to threaten one person, gathered all at once towards Priscilla. A lethal attack from all directions, it tried to capture the sun as it escaped its captivity――</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “I won’t let it!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Responding to that cry of parental love, the streets of the Imperial Capital shifted and moved before shooting out like spears.</p>
<p class="block_2">They blocked the blasts of light that were trying to reach Priscilla in the air, and a series of explosions and blasts painted the sky as they protected her.</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “Together, Beatrice!”</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “No need for you to say it, I suppose!”</p>
<p class="block_2">An amethyst glow appeared around Priscilla as she continued to descend through the blast of light. It was a disk-shaped crystal, acting as a shield to intercept the approaching balls of light, that was created by the combined efforts of both Spirit and mage to protect and defend Priscilla.</p>
<p class="block_2">However――</p>
<p class="block_2">Witch: “Not yet!”</p>
<p class="block_2">With emotion to the point of spitting blood, the Witch shouted.</p>
<p class="block_2">Immediately afterward, the disk was struck hard and began to creak; eventually, the cracks widened, and the disk shattered all at once.</p>
<p class="block_2">Having done so, the Witch, her white hair fluttering, rose into the sky and attempted to shower life-rending light upon Priscilla, as the latter fell unprotected.</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “Uuau!!”</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “I will not let you do that!”</p>
<p class="block_2">The blonde girl teleported from the ground, and the deergirl jumped and kicked with a force that could break the Crystal Palace, striking a blow to the torso of the Witch, who saw none else except Priscilla, at the same time.</p>
<p class="block_2">The Witch crumpled, and the heat ray that was fired missed its target.</p>
<p class="block_2">Witch: “Catalyst: Required.”</p>
<p class="block_2">The crumpled Witch shattered into bits of dirt, but even that was part of the plan of which she spoke.</p>
<p class="block_2">A moment later, multiple Witches on the ground joined hands with each other; because they were the same being, in perfect synchronization, they shortened the construction of a technique, generating a great storm.</p>
<p class="block_2">It became raging water, wind, and light, engulfing Priscilla in the sky.</p>
<p class="block_2">In the next moment, Priscilla would be torn to shreds, her body left in a pitiful state――</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “Icicle Line――!”</p>
<p class="block_2">The storm of destruction exploded from within, and what appeared next was not the torn figure of Priscilla, but rather a flower of ice that split open in the heavens as if to protect and adorn her.</p>
<p class="block_2">The great, ravishing flower petals trapped the light, not allowing it to reach Priscilla.</p>
<p class="block_2">And then, a figure furiously approached, as Priscilla defied all of the death, destruction, and demise that loomed around her.</p>
<p class="block_2">It was――</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “――Princess!!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Aldebaran rose from the ground of the Imperial Capital, stretching into the sky with a distorted, misshapen pillar of stone and earth beneath his feet, drawing ever closer to Priscilla.</p>
<p class="block_2">The column rapidly grew, and the distance between the falling Priscilla and the ascending Aldebaran shrank, and shrank, and shrank, and shrank―― until the distance became zero. </p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “――Hk.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Balancing on top of an unstable pillar, he stretched out his right arm to forcefully catch Priscilla as she fell. Just as they were about to fall together, Aldebaran secured his legs firmly atop the pillar, risking his life to protect Priscilla from the fall.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla’s almond-shaped eyes narrowed at Aldebaran’s life-or-death decisive action,</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “It is a great service.”</p>
<p class="block_2">As Priscilla briefly spoke, Aldebaran, overcome by emotion, bowed his head. Then he looked up, his voice trembling,</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Princess, Princess, my Princess…! Finally, again… OUCH!!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Nonsense. Who belongs to you?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla struck Aldebaran, who was on the brink of losing it, on the head with the hilt of her Yang Sword. Aldebaran instinctively crouched down as he felt the force of the blow, which threatened to dent his steel helmet. He was unable to rub the spot where he had been hit, as he was supporting Priscilla with his one arm.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla gave a short snicker to the pitiful Aldebaran, with a “Heh”,</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “However, that was an excellent effort from you. I bestow mine praise.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Well, I’m very grateful and honored… what about you, Princess? Everything okay? No injuries? Did they hurt you or anything? I mean, you look so pretty for someone who was being held captive.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Do not repeat such nonsense. In the first place, mine beauty is not going to diminish from being imprisoned for a short while. Mind your tongue, Al.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Held by his arm, Priscilla told him so in a stunning manner, and Aldebaran’s―― Al’s breath caught in his throat.</p>
<p class="block_2">Then, once again, he nodded deeply, confirming that Priscilla was indeed before him. To Al’s reaction, Priscilla, still in his embrace, looked around,</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Witness, the true star of the show. You shall have grand excitements.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Reflected in Priscilla’s eyes as she spoke atop the stone pillar were multiple figures, those who were putting their lives on the line in this battle, and in the eyes of each of them, a flame was lit.</p>
<p class="block_2">The flame of Priscilla Barielle’s soul blazed within the eyes of those she deemed worthy of love.</p>
<p class="block_2">That, of course, included――</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Princess?”</p>
<p class="block_2">With Al right beside her, she lifted the visor of the helmet he wore with her finger and peeked within―― The right eye upon his face, which he had never revealed to anyone but Priscilla, was lit by the same flame.</p>
<p class="block_2">Upon seeing this, Priscilla smiled pleasantly, and spoke.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “It is no matter of consequence―― As always, this world is made for my convenience.”</p>
