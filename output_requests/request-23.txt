<p class="block_2">――It was a feeling similar to that of being buried from the neck down in a dark place.</p>
<p class="block_2">Their feet sunk into the unending mixture of earth, sand, and pebbles, which eventually reached their waist, chest, and shoulders, leaving only their head exposed.</p>
<p class="block_2">It was only a matter of time before their head was buried in the cold dust that was gradually piling up.</p>
<p class="block_2">Desperately turning their head upward, they tried to breathe out the dust that was piling up, trying as hard as they could to postpone even just a little the moment they would suffocate, the moment they would be buried up to the top of their head.</p>
<p class="block_2">From the time they were born until today, they had never felt so much discomfort.</p>
<p class="block_2">Their mind was always unstable, like walking on water, but their body had never been like that. They were sure that they were better at moving their body than most people.</p>
<p class="block_2">Once that source of comfort was taken away from them, they felt like crying, thinking about how helpless they were. But, they did not know how to shed tears. They were not even good at crying.</p>
<p class="block_2">They lacked in just about everything. Still, there were things they wanted.</p>
<p class="block_2">They were all too unaware of it, but they finally realized it―― They finally realized how greedy they had been.</p>
<p class="block_2">And then――</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Suddenly, the feeling of dust pouring down from above disappeared.</p>
<p class="block_2">It hit their forehead softly, and the feeling of it burying them as though spilling out stopped, and a flickering blue-white light illuminated the area as it swirled around them.</p>
<p class="block_2">The light that flashed provocatively around their field of vision was uncontrollably irritating, and they struggled, and struggled, and struggled, and eventually, the arms of their body, buried up to their neck, reached up into the air.</p>
<p class="block_2">As if escaping their outstretched hand, the pale-blue light went a little higher again.</p>
<p class="block_2">Wanting to chase after it, they forcefully pulled their buried body out in order to reach the heights they could not reach. They got their shoulders out, their chest, and if they could get their waist out, then they would just be one breath away.</p>
<p class="block_2">Eventually, when they were out to their toes, they looked up and tried to catch the blue-white light, and realized something.</p>
<p class="block_2">There was a red flame right in front of them that brilliantly lit up the area.</p>
<p class="block_2">Then, the blue-white light that they were trying to catch wrapped itself around them, trying to push them toward the radiant flames.</p>
<p class="block_2">For a moment, there was hesitation. But not due to fear of the flames.</p>
<p class="block_2">They hesitated, wondering if their cold self was worthy of the fortune of being burned by the flames.</p>
<p class="block_2">However, that hesitation was only momentary.</p>
<p class="block_2">It was not about whether they were qualified or not, but whether or not they wanted to be burned.</p>
<p class="block_2">They were going to be burned, or so they thought.</p>
<p class="block_2">That was why――</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “――Enough of this, wake up. How much longer do you intend to keep mineself waiting?”</p>
<p class="block_2">They took one step forward, straight ahead, to be burned by that gentle flame.</p>
<p class="block_2">One step forward――</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “…Princess, I, did my best.”</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “It is only natural―― Just who do you take mine foster sister for?”</p>
<p class="block_12">△▼△▼△▼△</p>
<p class="block_2">――At that moment, the Witch, Sphinx, was convinced that all of her plans had fallen apart.</p>
<p class="block_2">Having given rise to the hosts of undead as the Great Disaster, she had ascertained the whereabouts of the soul through the countless amounts of trial and error they had carried out, and utilizing that, she had accomplished her purpose of creation, to reproduce the Witch of Greed.</p>
<p class="block_2">In addition, through the act of killing the Stone, Muspel, by having it use the architecture of the Sacrament of the Immortal King technique, and inducing the collapse of the Vollachian Empire’s vast lands, putting an end to all things that comprised the Empire, she would show Priscilla Barielle, the sole person placed within the alternate space, the destruction of her homeland.</p>
<p class="block_2">By doing so, Sphinx had plotted to enact retribution, triumph, revenge, supremacy, conquest, overthrowal, vanquishment, sacrilege, subjugation, a rise, a fall, a rampage, exultation, happiness, or at least just “something” against Priscilla, who had invited the death of Leip Barielle, the man who had taught Sphinx this repulsive, foul “ardor”.</p>
<p class="block_2">All of that was completely, unsparingly, until no part would remain recognizable, falling apart.</p>
<p class="block_2">Sphinx: “――The Sacrament of the Immortal King is…”</p>
<p class="block_2">The fact that its effects had been lost, was something that Sphinx could not help but recognize.</p>
<p class="block_2">Centered around the Imperial Capital of Lupugana, the five locations aligning with the north, east, south, and west of the Vollachian Empire―― spread out over the sites designated as the points of settlement for the ever-migrating Stone, using the blood permeated into the Vollachian Empire’s vast lands as a medium, the magic circle had continued to resurrect the dead via the Sacrament of the Immortal King.</p>
<p class="block_2">However, that too would come to an end if the vast supply of Mana from the Stone was lost.</p>
<p class="block_2">Sphinx: “The Spirit Eater, Arakiya… has she seized control over Muspel?”</p>
<p class="block_2">At the unthinkable reality, she could do nothing but surmise based on the events that had transpired.</p>
<p class="block_2">That which she had taken upon herself was a far too exceedingly powerful Great Spirit, and even though Arakiya was supposed to have burst asunder after taking it in, the exorcism performed by the swordsman wielding the Dream Sword Masayume had placed the Great Spirit under her complete dominion.</p>
<p class="block_2">By this point, the Stone, Muspel, was already one and the same as the Spirit Eater, Arakiya.</p>
<p class="block_2">And, Arakiya had no reason to disobey the Vollachian Empire and support the Great Disaster.</p>
<p class="block_2">From here on out――</p>
<p class="block_2">Sphinx: “The undead will not revive anymore.”</p>
<p class="block_2">The immortal army, the pack of dead wolves who could endlessly revive in their death, the prerequisite for that had collapsed.</p>
<p class="block_2">Even if the supply from the Stone was severed, it did not mean the undead would lose their lives immediately. Only, the playing field had been leveled―― Death meant the end, just like it did for the living.</p>
<p class="block_2">Sphinx: “――Hk.”</p>
<p class="block_2">With the supply of Mana to the magic circle severed, she had spent around five seconds sorting out the situation.</p>
<p class="block_2">But, in those mere five seconds, Sphinx, who had already been reduced to thirty-six bodies, was diminished by another seven, bringing her total count down to twenty-nine.</p>
<p class="block_2">Moving with superhuman speed and combat ability, the Blue Lightning and the Admirer were far too powerful.</p>
<p class="block_2">Although she was supposed to be able to reproduce the capacity of her creator, the Witch of Greed, she could not hold her own in the slightest. She could not even get a solid hit in. These opponents were on a level such that she could not even overcome them by sheer force of numbers.</p>
<p class="block_2">Even if she wanted to do something about that, those two fighting were not the only ones up against the Witch. Hence――</p>
<p class="block_2">Sphinx: “――Retreat: Required.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Sphinx: “――Retreat: Required.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Sphinx: “――Retreat: Required.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Having arrived at a situation in which she was powerless, the Witch, Sphinx, deemed the annulment of her plan the most rational course of action.</p>
<p class="block_2">She had prepared a steadfast resolve, worked out infallible stratagems, and had commenced her plan with everything in place, but to still have everything overturned to this extent, meant that modifying her plan was no longer possible.</p>
<p class="block_2">It was aggravating, but her best option was to accept it given that she had accomplished one of her two overarching objectives.</p>
<p class="block_2">In fact, she had fulfilled her long-standing purpose of creation that had been given to her by her creator. Compared to the purpose she had pursued for over three-hundred years, there was no way that the objective she had desired for merely a year was of equal value.</p>
<p class="block_2">Sphinx: “――Retreat: Required.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Sphinx: “――Retreat: Required.”</p>
<p class="block_2">To begin with, the situation had never been one with balanced scales.</p>
<p class="block_2">The reason for which she had been created, she reaffirmed her perception of it. What was required of her was the advent of the Witch of Greed, and she was certainly achieving that.</p>
<p class="block_2">Painting over her current self as Sphinx, by becoming the Witch of Greed, Echidna――</p>
<p class="block_2">Sphinx: “――Retreat: Required.”</p>
<p class="block_2">She would be remade. With that, her purpose of creation would be fulfilled. </p>
<p class="block_2">With the disappearance of Sphinx, and the revival of Echidna, her days of obsession lasting over three-hundred years would come to a close.</p>
<p class="block_2">To desire anything more than that would not be rational. It would not be rational. It would not, be rational.</p>
<p class="block_2">Even though it would not be rational――</p>
<p class="block_2">Sphinx: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">That instant, a hoisted Yang Sword unleashed a dazzling scintillation, displaying their own presence throughout the entirety of the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p class="block_2">Having scorched through the alternate space, having forcibly made a return to the skies of the Imperial Capital, having surmounted the future that ought to have torn her limb from limb as if it were only natural, it was a provocation appealing to the Witch, who had decided to retreat.</p>
<p class="block_2">Clad in a dress red like blood, with the hue of her hair bright like the sun, her dazzling presence radiating like a blaze, the woman who could not live in any other way but to scorch others like a flame, smiled. </p>
<p class="block_2">Woman: “――You had better come, Sphinx. For thine enemy, is mineself.”</p>
<p class="block_2">That instant, the twenty-nine Witches, the twenty-nine Sphinxes, every single one of them made up their minds.</p>
<p class="block_2">That being――</p>
<p class="block_2">Sphinx: “――I, AM YOUR ENEMY, PRISCILLA BARIELLE!!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Sphinx: “――I, AM YOUR ENEMY, PRISCILLA BARIELLE!!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Sphinx: “――I, AM YOUR ENEMY, PRISCILLA BARIELLE!!”</p>
