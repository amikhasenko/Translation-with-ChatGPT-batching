<p class="block_2">――The Great Disaster averted, the Sacred Vollachian Empire had at last escaped ruin.</p>
<p class="block_2">With the Imperial Capital at its center, the hosts of undead that had been deployed throughout the entire Empire had lost their leadership, and fell apart; as they scattered and fled, the battle approached its curtain’s close. However, though their commander, Sphinx, was no more, though the Mana that had been provided to the Sacrament of the Immortal King by the Stone had been severed, until they were granted death once more, the resurrected undead still struggled onward with the entirety of their new lives.</p>
<p class="block_2">Albeit the struggle against the Great Disaster had concluded in this manner, the scars it had left behind would never disappear.</p>
<p class="block_2">It was quite possible that, from here on out within the Vollachian Empire, the undead that had managed to escape would frequently cause trouble. Even without that, even with the war itself having ended, everything that had been influenced by it would never truly be put right once and for all.</p>
<p class="block_2">Naturally, the towns and regions that had become warfronts, and the people and things that had become casualties, would all need to be verified so that they could be processed and returned to their pre-war state.</p>
<p class="block_2">And sadly, things such as “heroic reveries” were of no use to the post-war recovery.</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “So, it’s unexpectedly true that I’ve got nothing to do…”</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “――What was that? Do you have complaints towards mineself?”</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “It’s not that I’m complaining, it’s just, like, a strange feeling?”</p>
<p class="block_2">As Subaru grumbled that out, walking alongside him was a beautiful woman―― Priscilla, the words he had directed towards her having been carefully selected. In response to Subaru’s reply, she used a fan she held to cover her lips, a small “Hmph” slipping from her mouth.</p>
<p class="block_2">To that response, one he was well-accustomed to, Subaru tilted his head in wonder as he walked alongside her.</p>
<p class="block_2">――Presently, the place in which Subaru and Priscilla were walking together, was within the walls of the Fortified City of Garkla.</p>
<p class="block_2">The greatest fortress within the Empire, its ramparts had become extensively damaged by the advance of the undead hordes, with the citizenry and army unquestioningly working day and night to move forward the repair work. To walk alongside Priscilla in such a cityscape, it was a strange happenstance.</p>
<p class="block_2">Both Subaru and Priscilla had been participants at the battleground of the Imperial Capital of Lupugana in the decisive bout against the Great Disaster, Sphinx, and it was their anxiety for the wellbeing of those that they had left behind, and the disastrous spectacle of the Imperial Capital, unfit for settlement, that had prompted their return to this city.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “The Crystal Palace, once extolled as the most beautiful in the world, is now naught but ash, and the water yet contained within the reservoir still threatens to cascade forth and sweep away the city. As things stand, it shall take a century to restore the Imperial Capital.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Things there were on a pretty huge <i class="calibre4">sunbou</i><sup class="calibre5"><a class="calibre2" href="index_split_032.html#note_36" id="back_note_36" title="36">36</a></sup>… Hold on a sec, should the person responsible for turning the Palace into ash really be saying that?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “As soon as it began to rampage as a golem, even without mine actions being enacted, the recovery of its Palace form was no longer a possibility. As such, mineself used it as a ceremonial flame to herald their send-off, for they had fully carried out the role of Great Disaster.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “――A ceremonial bonfire for Sphinx, huh.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla responded calmly, and as Subaru thought about the enemy, Sphinx, he cast his eyes downward.</p>
<p class="block_2">This was not something that anyone who participated in the battle against the Great Disaster could say, but at the very end, in order to activate the effects of Spica’s Star Eating, Subaru had faced off against Sphinx directly.</p>
<p class="block_2">At that moment, Subaru and Sphinx had laid their souls bare to one another.</p>
<p class="block_2">That was probably why. Subaru could not hate Sphinx, and regard her as evil from the bottom of his heart. At least, she was not an unforgivable enemy like the Sin Archbishops, that was what he felt.</p>
<p class="block_2">And it was something similar to this, which he thought Priscilla may have felt――</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “It was a truly magnificent pillar of flame. After all, it is truly elating to see something burn.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Nah, what if it’s just that you like to burn things!?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “My, so noisy. Do not suddenly use such a loud voice. That is very much like Al, is it not?”</p>
<p class="block_2">At first glance, it sounded like an insult, but Priscilla’s lips were curled into a smile as she spoke. It was a difficult relationship to grasp, but she cared about her Knight, Al, in her own way.</p>
<p class="block_2">That much could not be questioned after the reunion of Priscilla and Al at the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “And, on that note, Al wouldn’t want to be separated from you, so where is he right now?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “It is as you say. As he did not wish to be separated from mineself, he was ordered to be a servant. At this time, he should be working hard as he salivates for mine praise. Just like you, who is head over heels for the half-devil.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “I can’t and won’t deny it, but I feel bad for how Al is being used…”</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “――Priscilla-sama!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Hearing a voice say “Oh”, Subaru raised his eyebrows, and with a small run across the opposite side of the street, a small boy―― Schult’s figure came into his sight. The small boy in shorts and a butler’s outfit was breathing heavily, coming to a sudden halt in front of Priscilla, and,</p>
<p class="block_2">Schult: “Um, Priscilla-sama, thank goodness you are safe, that is the most important thing! I am… I really am, so… waahhh…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “A child should not be concerned with such foolish trifles. If you are worried about mineself, then be so with dignity.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Saying this, Prisicilla embraced Schult, who had come to a halt, the young boy’s head becoming buried in her breasts. Rather than a metaphor, the statement that he was buried in her breasts was a fact, so it felt like looking at a difference in biological species rather than a difference in gender.</p>
<p class="block_2">Like Al, Schult was one of Priscilla’s servants, and he had been truly worried about her return from the Imperial Capital, his face turning red as he melted into her touch.</p>
<p class="block_2">In fact, for him to be this delighted at the return of the Imperial Capital group―― the Rescue the Vollachian Empire from Destruction Squad, it had been worth hastening the dragon carriage for their return.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “It was also worth it since as soon as I reunited with Patrasche in this form, she immediately hit me…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Schult: “Natsuki-sama, I was hoping that you could convey my thanks to Emily-sama! Also, I would like to help Priscilla-sama more, so I wish to hear the secret behind how you grew up so fast!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “I’d love to see Emilia-tan’s smug face when she receives as much gratitude as possible, but my rapid growth is a cheat technique. If you go down the normal <i class="calibre4">shinro</i><sup class="calibre5"><a class="calibre2" href="index_split_032.html#note_37" id="back_note_37" title="37">37</a></sup> but grow quickly, then I think you might die from the growing pains.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Regardless, you need not recklessly grow any taller. Stay the way you are for the time being.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Schult: “Uuu, I am caught between a rock and a hard place…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Caught between his own wishes and the desire of his master, Schult’s anguish was plain to see on his face as he was caught between these competing ideals. Subaru, understanding his feelings towards Priscilla which could not be attached to just deep affection or admiration, sympathized with his anguish.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Well, even if I sympathize with you, I can’t give you any <i class="calibre4">kankoku</i><sup class="calibre5"><a class="calibre2" href="index_split_032.html#note_38" id="back_note_38" title="38">38</a></sup>!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Rather than a fool, you are a pitiful man. Schult, are you walking by yourself?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Schult: “No, that is not the case! I was with Utakata-sama and all the Shudraqians, so I…”</p>
<p class="block_2">In the middle of Priscilla’s breasts, the buried Schult glanced behind him. Following the lead of this glance, he discovered a recognizable, sour-faced man―― Heinkel.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru was aware that he had come to the Empire, and that he had contributed to fighting against the Great Disaster, but.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Schult, that old man isn’t bullying you, is he?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Schult: “That is not the case! Heinkel-sama is a kind personage!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “That’s definitely a lie.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Spreading false perceptions, even regarding close associates, was sub-optimal. Saying that Heinkel was kind, was like saying that Roswaal was a good and honest person.</p>
<p class="block_2">In fact, even Heinkel seemed to be bitter about Schult’s evaluation.</p>
<p class="block_2">Heinkel: “Pipsqueak, don’t say needless things. I’ll cast you away.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Do not utter such nonsense, commoner. It is for mineself to decide how Schult is handled. Rather, it is you who ought be afraid of being abandoned in the Empire.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Heinkel: “Guh…! This time, I, against that… against, that, I…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Was of use? If you wish to boast so, at minimum you must speak clearly.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Towards Heinkel’s frown and mumbling, Priscilla spoke with a bored look. She then turned Schult away from her chest, pushing him towards Heinkel.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Schult, there are many people I must still visit. It is late. Do not stay up into the night.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Schult: “I… I understand…! I feel somewhat unable to sleep, but I shall do my best to get some rest!”</p>
<p class="block_2">To Schult, who was still excited, Priscilla nodded with a “Very well”. After that, she looked towards the one close to Schult, towards Heinkel, who was unable to speak.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “It was a great service, Heinkel Astrea.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Heinkel: “Ah?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Your way of life is too unsightly to bear gaze upon, but the ability with the sword that you have forged is a worthy sight. Absolutely, even if you are never rewarded, you must never forget your diligence.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Heinkel: “…Though, whether I get rewarded or not is up to you, Miss Priscilla.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Saying this, Heinkel turned away, roughly scratching at his red hair as he walked away.</p>
<p class="block_2">To that distancing back, Subaru called out with an “Old man”, and,</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “I heard you saved Garfiel―― You looked after my little bro.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Heinkel: “――Keh.”</p>
<p class="block_2">With his foul attitude, Heinkel walked away without stopping. Schult bowed his head, hurriedly chasing after his back after seeing them off, while Subaru shrugged towards Priscilla.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “You didn’t give me a proper answer when I asked this before, but why are you with Reinhard’s dad?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “There is no such person known as the father of another. It is a question I have no inclination to answer.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Ugh… When you tell me that so straightforwardly, my chest begins to hurt.”</p>
<p class="block_2">When Subaru clutched at his chest, Prisiclla poked at his head with her fan and said “Fool”. As Subaru rubbed at where he had been poked, Priscilla lightly stroked her chin.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Well now, are you trying to bore mineself? Perform your duties as a jester well, Natsuki Subaru.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Once again she called him by his name, yet for some reason, he had no desire to go against it.</p>
<p class="block_12">△▼△▼△▼△</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “Have the two of you come to engrave a frown onto my face while I am occupied?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Thus asked Abel, brow as wrinkled as his words suggested, upon seeing Subaru and Priscilla arrive.</p>
<p class="block_2">This room in the great fortress, albeit not sophisticated enough to call an office, had served as Abel’s workspace for a restless night of urgent planning in regards to postwar measures.</p>
<p class="block_2">A great shift in tone from having brandished the Yang Sword along with Priscilla against the moving palace.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Man, it’s incredibly off-putting for you to be tough now. There’s no way we’d be able to have another <i class="calibre4">catfight</i>.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Vincent: “I have never wished to partake in such bizarre rituals with you. If your purpose is to distract me with these trifles, exit at once.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “You say you want no distractions, but…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru glanced at the sofa beside the desk where the inhospitable Emperor tended to his task. There, Flop and Medium slept shoulder-to-shoulder in harmony.</p>
<p class="block_2">The O’Connell siblings’ cozy reunion evoked a striking contrast next to the Emperor.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “I don’t see you kicking those two out.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Vincent: “…They guarantee me further nuisances if I rouse them, that is why.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “You do not disappoint with your pretexts, elder brother. Your leniency manifests in its full glory when faced with what is most precious. When you had allowed me to flee from the country, that too had been an act of love.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Abel was silenced by Priscilla’s calm words, spoken as she fanned her face.</p>
<p class="block_2">That could have been interpreted as a silence that would have emerged no matter what had been said, a silence that had emerged precisely because the words had hit the mark, or even both.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “You <span class="text_1">siscon</span> Emperor…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Vincent: “Albeit I know not the meaning, I presume that those words of yours are the height of irreverence.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Cease with the empty threats. Due to the Great Disaster on this occasion, the Empire has forged far too many debts towards the Kingdom and the City-States. Especially towards the camp of Natsuki Subaru’s bunch, is that not so?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Priscilla… it’s not my camp, it’s Emilia-tan’s.”</p>
<p class="block_2">It was a rare follow-up on the part of Priscilla, but he had to firmly correct her on an important part. Priscilla returned a “You are quite well-trained” with an expression slightly taken aback, and Abel silently massaged his brow with his fingers.</p>
<p class="block_2">“Woah”, uttered Subaru when he witnessed Abel proceed to close both eyes.</p>
<p class="block_2">Vincent: “――What is the matter, Natsuki Subaru? Do you intend to pile up even more irreverence towards me?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Nah, not this time. Not like I want trouble with you, and since you’re busy, I should just leave.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Pouting his lips, Subaru did not point out the fact which he had noticed. He did not think Abel to be unaware of it, either. That was because the reason and impetus for that change, had occurred in a definite form.</p>
<p class="block_2">And, it seemed that Subaru was not the only one who considered that a pleasant change.</p>
<p class="block_2">Vincent: “I extend that to you, Priscilla. I have many matters due.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “So you put the Empire above your dear sister? With a decade passed, have the scales within yourself finally come to a settlement, elder brother? If that is so…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Vincent: “What?”</p>
<p class="block_2">As Priscilla cut off her words, Abel made a slight frown. In front of Abel, Priscilla pinched the hem of her dress, and gave a deep bow where she stood. And then――</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “――Seventy-Seventh Emperor of the Sacred Vollachian Empire, Your Excellency Vincent Vollachia. From the bottom of mine heart, I celebrate your ascendance to the throne.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Vincent: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “To the utmost, laboriously endeavor to lead the pack of Sword Wolves. For the time being, the days bereft of respite shall only continue.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Delivering words of congratulations with a serious expression, and then a warning with a bold smile, Priscilla spoke to her elder brother. At the attitude of his sister, whose tempo was as per her whims, Abel―― Vincent Vollachia heaved a sigh.</p>
<p class="block_2">Then, glancing towards the O’Connell siblings, sleeping on the sofa with their shoulders pressed against each other,</p>
<p class="block_2">Vincent: “Priscilla―― In this entire world, only with you, sister mine, could I prescind from mistrust.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Ever so sinuous you are, brother mine, even in your confessions of love.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Concealing a provocative smirk behind her noisily-opened fan, Priscilla interpreted Abel’s statement. Subaru found himself in total agreement with her.</p>
<p class="block_2">If there was only one thing that a third party could add onto that――</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “From my perspective, you two siblings resemble each other to an aggravating extent.”</p>
<p class="block_2">And in saying so, Subaru took the brunt of those cognate siblings’ matching, unamused glares.</p>
<p class="block_12">△▼△▼△▼△</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “Were you speaking with His Excellency Vincent, Priscilla?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Hm, Dear Mother, is it?”</p>
<p class="block_2">After having their fill of two kinds of sibling relationships within the Empire, one team Imperial Family and the other team merchant, Subaru and Priscilla ran into Yorna in a passageway of the fortress, along with Eugard, who was accompanying her.</p>
<p class="block_2">It appeared that they were heading to Abel’s room, as if they had business to attend to with him.</p>
<p class="block_2">Yorna narrowed her almond-shaped eyes, and fixedly gazed at Subaru and Priscilla. Subaru had thought that it was because she found this pairing to be unusual, but he was wrong.</p>
<p class="block_2">Yorna: “It is only my first time seeing it, but I find it will be quite the challenge to get used to seeing you with your limbs lengthened like this, child.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “…Ah! Now that you mention it, Yorna-san has only ever seen me in my cross-dressing and <i class="calibre4">shota</i> forms!?”</p>
<p class="block_2">As the astounding truth emerged, Subaru was shocked at his own abundance of variation within the Empire. At Subaru’s shock, Yorna placed the back of her hand to her mouth, and while smiling,</p>
<p class="block_2">Yorna: “Your Excellency, this personage is a Knight of the Kingdom. Until just the other day, he had been shrunken down to the form of a child, and during our first meeting together, he was in the form of a beautiful lady.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Eugard: “Hm. For Mine Star to sanction such an appraisal of beauty in thyself, I shan’t say that mine interest hath not been piqued.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “No no not at all, please stop with that kind of stuff. Though, Natsumi Schwartz is a noble-minded lady who wouldn’t be embarrassed at showing herself off to anybody…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Although your skills are praiseworthy for a foolish commoner, your self-esteem is quite distorted.”</p>
<p class="block_2">At Subaru’s answer, which tread the line between composed and passionate, Priscilla gave a comment in a fed-up manner. Afterwards, she casually turned her attention towards Abel’s room,</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “For what reason are you visiting mine elder brother with the King of Thorns, Dear Mother?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Eugard: “‘Tis because the time that remaineth for mineself is meager. Before that reacheth its terminus, I wish to discuss matters pertaining to the wishes of Mine Star with the child of mine own children.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Time remaining…”</p>
<p class="block_2">At Eugard’s response, Subaru looked towards Yorna, who looked pleased.</p>
<p class="block_2">――Eugard was present here with Yorna with a natural attitude, but he was still one of the undead. Like Sphinx, his appearance was by no means inferior to that of the living, but that fact would not sway.</p>
<p class="block_2">Eugard: “In all likelihood, mine newfound sense of satisfaction towards mine own life hath borne an influence upon mine appearance. As for mineself, rather than sharing in an embrace with Mine Star via a body in which heat doth not flow, this is much preferable.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Albeit it may be a linkage of soul rather than blood, you unashamedly boast of your love towards a mother right before her daughter. I suppose that is exactly what one would expect from the King of Thorns, but… what is this about mine Dear Mother’s wishes?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Yorna: “――It is in regards to the shackles upon my soul, endlessly invoking its reincarnation.”</p>
<p class="block_2">The outline of Yorna’s quiet words was something which Subaru only knew of on a surface level.</p>
<p class="block_2">Yorna was formerly a girl known as Iris who was bound to unending resurrection; each time she died, her soul would return to the surface without receiving the baptism of Od Lagna, and she would reincarnate into her next body.</p>
<p class="block_2">Therefore, what Yorna desired from Abel for her contributions in the civil war and against the Great Disaster on this occasion, was――</p>
<p class="block_2">Yorna: “――I wish to repeal it. To annul the decree of extinction put out by the Empire in regards to the wolfpeople and the molepeople.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Eh…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Yorna: “All along, such had been my desire… Though, when I became a Divine General, I had prioritized acquiring the Demon City, so as to have a location to welcome my beloved children.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “――I see. In order to bind your soul, Dear Mother, the two races that are the wolfpeople and the molepeople, their bodies and lives, which have been piled up since times of yore, were being utilized, and if that supply were to be severed, the curse would disappear naturally.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Eugard: “And in those days, ‘twas none other than mineself who had passed the decree. If a request cometh from mine mouth to the Emperor of the current age, matters shall be settled with no harm befalling the honor of Mine Star and the child of mine own children.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Saying that, Eugard turned a tender gaze towards Yorna, who was hugging his arm.</p>
<p class="block_2">In that moment, Subaru understood that deep within the eyes of the King of Thorns’s invariant expression, there were smoldering sentiments of shame and remorse that had spanned many years.</p>
<p class="block_2">“Iris and the King of Thorns”―― within the tale recited in this world since times of old, he did not know just what sort of drama had occurred between him and her.</p>
<p class="block_2">However, supposing it had ended in tragedy, this was its after story.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “In that case, I think it’s good so long as you at least have a <i class="calibre4">shuushou</i><sup class="calibre5"><a class="calibre2" href="index_split_032.html#note_39" id="back_note_39" title="39">39</a></sup> with a nice aftertaste.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Then we are of differing opinions. There are plenty of superfluous acts that can be taken in the afterlife to make things redundant.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “You! Listen! Here! Alright…!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla, who was supposed to be the daughter of one of the parties involved, despite it being a complex relationship, had attempted to stir up discord, so Subaru was about to scold her to read the mood. But, before he could do so, she continued with “But”,</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “If it is the King of Thorns and mine Dear Mother, no such tactless acts shall be taken.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Eugard: “――As ever, thou bearest Terriola’s likeness. Dost thou not think so, O Star of Mine?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Yorna: “Now that you mention it… it is no wonder I find her to be so lovely.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Do not conduct such speech akin to comparing mineself with those other than mineself. If it were not you and your husband, Dear Mother, I would not pardon it.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Being told so bluntly by Priscilla, a smile formed on the lips of both Yorna and Eugard.</p>
<p class="block_2">It was a strange relationship, and although this was not the case in reality, from the outside looking in, they seemed like an intimate mother, father, and daughter, so Subaru scratched his cheek with a somewhat awkward feeling.</p>
<p class="block_2">At Subaru’s gesture, Yorna smiled, saying “It seems we have caused you tedium”,</p>
<p class="block_2">Yorna: “I shall go now with His Excellency. Priscilla dear, you mustn’t bicker with the child.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “I do not treat him as a child. To begin with, if this foolish commoner angers me, I shall simply lop his head off.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Don’t say such scary things! Well then, Yorna-san, Eugard-san, until we meet again.”</p>
<p class="block_2">As Yorna and Priscilla had an exchange befitting a mother and daughter, Subaru called out to Eugard―― He had said “until we meet again”, but he felt like this would be the last time.</p>
<p class="block_2">The other party certainly had thought likewise. The former Emperor looked directly at Subaru, and spoke.</p>
<p class="block_2">Eugard: “Thou ought spend thy days of virtue together with those whom thou lovest. May good fortune and happiness be upon both thee and thy star.”</p>
<p class="block_12">△▼△▼△▼△</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “Wow, to see Subaru and Priscilla together, It’s reaaally surprising.”</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “It truly is, ain’t it. There’s plenty that we need to get done, so it’d be trouble if it rains tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="block_2">At Anastasia who, after saying so, had turned to gaze out the window at the night sky, Priscilla snorted with a “Hmph”.</p>
<p class="block_2">Having had the opportunity to talk to many people, they had stopped by the lounge for a glass of water, and had unexpectedly come across Emilia and Anastasia, who were seated at a table, facing each other.</p>
<p class="block_2">Since their adventure to the Pleiades Watchtower, such a pairing could no longer be considered peculiar. Rather, it was much more surprising that Subaru was with Priscilla, as per the lines of Emilia’s surprise.</p>
<p class="block_2">In any case, what was this pair with different roles, one the brains and the other the brawn, doing here?</p>
<p class="block_2">Emilia: “Well, actually, Otto-kun scolded me, saying I shouldn’t work anymore today…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Anastasia: “First of all, it ain’t all that good for us to be meddlin’ in the Empire’s post-war proceedin’s, now is it? So I thought, why not chat a tad before we rest… and whaddya know, Emilia-san’s been braggin’ ‘bout Natsuki-kun nonstop.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Eh, talking about me? Emilia-tan has? Lemme hear, lemme hear.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Hearing of some intriguing girl-talk, Subaru leaned forward. However, with Subaru’s collar having been grabbed from behind, he shrieked out with a “Gweh!”.</p>
<p class="block_2">As expected, the one who had done so, quite capable of decapitating Subaru let alone strangling him, was Priscilla. She let go of Subaru’s collar, and glared at Emilia and Anastasia as if to rein them in,</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “A half-devil and the she-fox, both fellow candidates in the Royal Selection, meeting face-to-face, and the topic of discussion is the exploits of a foolish commoner? Time is not to be spent so worthlessly. Even counting the stars would be marginally less objectionable.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Emilia: “Ah, I get it. When I was alone in the forest, I would sometimes do that to pass the time…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Anastasia: “As for me, I’ve spent long hours countin’ the money I’ve saved up.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Hey, hey, it’s not good to let the topic of conversation veer off like that because of Priscilla’s thoughtless words.”</p>
<p class="block_2">To say that one should be counting stars instead, was a rash comment on the level of telling them to just give up on everything and just go to sleep. Of course, if it were the stars, Subaru could spend countless hours searching for constellations, but that was beside the point.</p>
<p class="block_2">As he tried to prevent that retort from rapidly spreading the conversation into the realm of the night sky, Emilia suddenly laughed with a “Hehe”.</p>
<p class="block_2">Emilia: “Still, it feels reaaally strange doesn’t it. Me, Anastasia-san and Priscilla-san, we’re all candidates for the Kingdom’s Monarch, and yet all of us are in the Empire like so.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Anastasia: “If only Natsuki-kun hadn’t been so careless as to be sent away from the Tower, none of this would’ve happened.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “That was beyond my control, besides, if I hadn’t been sent away, the Empire would likely have been destroyed.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Although in no way did it make up for the event that started it all, considering the scale of the Great Disaster, those words were not far from the truth. It was not to say that he had enjoyed being sent away, but that it had served a purpose.</p>
<p class="block_2">But then again, Priscilla would likely snicker and scoff at such a reasoning――</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “――Indeed that is so. Without you lot, the history of the Empire would have come to an end yesterday.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Wah!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Emilia: “Huh?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Anastasia: “Oh?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “No need to gasp like fools. It was but a statement of an obvious fact.”</p>
<p class="block_2">That was all there was to it, was what Priscilla had said, but the fact that it was <i class="calibre4">her</i> who had said it, had surprised Subaru and the others.</p>
<p class="block_2">At those unexpected words from Priscilla, Anastasia chuckled saying “What’s this now”,</p>
<p class="block_2">Anastasia: “How darn surprisin’. Didn’t think ya’d be so upfront n’ admit that we helped ya.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Do not misunderstand. In the first place, the Empire was Prisca Benedict’s homeland, and thus is no longer the homeland of mineself. The responsibility for the survival of the Empire rests upon the Emperor and the army that bows to him.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Anastasia: “Had only just thought so, but there she is. Yep yep, if the Princess ain’t this way, she wouldn’t be a worthy rival.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Emilia: “Geez, Priscilla is such a contrarian, so don’t tease her, Anastasia-san.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Who even says contrarian these days…”</p>
<p class="block_2">At that very Emilia-like assessment, Subaru chucked, with equal parts exasperation and admiration.</p>
<p class="block_2">However, it was not as though he could not understand Emilia and Anastasia’s feelings. Previously, Priscilla had been such an entity unknown to Subaru, like an alien creature he could not fathom.</p>
<p class="block_2">And although he had acknowledged her strength and insight, the nature of her humanity seemed like that of a carnivorous beast that could not be reasoned with.</p>
<p class="block_2">That impression he held of Priscilla, he felt it had changed plenty, over these past few days in the Empire.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Right now, just like Emilia-tan and Anastasia-san, as well as Crusch-san and Felt, I can actually recognize Priscilla as a Royal Selection Candidate.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “For what reason would I be in need of your recognition? Watch your mouth, foolish commoner.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Emilia: “There you go again with that harsh way of speaking… but, we also had briefly spoken about that. Right?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Emilia had clasped her hands before her chest, and Anastasia, whom she had called out to, smiled softly.</p>
<p class="block_2">Anastasia: “Y’know, that whole thin’ at Pristella? At the time, I hadn’t invited the Princess over ‘cause I felt there wasn’t a reason to, but…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Emilia: “Then next time, let’s invite Priscilla too. Especially since she’s a Royal Candidate, like us.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Foolish commoner, it seems your master is unaware of what sort of event the Royal Selection even is.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “She’s cute, isn’t she? Behold, my angel.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Although a vacation had not been the intention behind the meeting of the candidates in Pristella, from the way Emilia would see it, she must have felt bad about Priscilla seemingly having been excluded from the gathering.</p>
<p class="block_2">That said, rather than a situation in which the Witch Cult went on a rampage, a vacation would be much better.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “If it does come to that, let’s go someplace where we can have a swimsuit vacation next time.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Anastasia: “Ain’t Natsuki-kun a straightforward child ‘bout his desires. Well, not like I ain’t gonna consider it. Of course, if the Princess says she’s fine with not bein’ invited, we ain’t gonna invite her, right?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Emilia: “Priscilla… What do you think?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Anastasia had been provocative, while Emilia had been timid like a small animal. As expected, at the invitation from the two beautiful girls who were also Royal Candidates, Priscilla shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Do as you please. If it shall amuse, then very well, if not, ‘tis poor. No reason in particular for mineself to refuse.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Emilia: “――! Yes, let’s do that. We’re all in a difficult position, and we all have very many things that worry us but… I don’t see any reason why we all can’t get along.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Anastasia: “Whenever Emilia-san’s involved, everythin’s all mellow, it’s a bit troublesome.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla’s answer could not be taken as being enthusiastic, but the way Emilia had taken it, made it sound like she had been chomping at the bit, and Subaru nodded in agreement with Anastasia’s thoughts.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla as well, seemingly not bothering to correct her, looked up at the night sky――</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “――A lass from the slums and a Duchess, as well the she-fox of the City-States and an amethyst-eyed half-devil.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Emilia: “――? Priscilla?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “‘Tis no matter of significance. I merely had the thought that, when listed out like so, it sounds akin to characters starring in a poorly penned tale.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “That «poorly penned» was unnecessary. In the first place, I don’t think you’re in any position to talk.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla, basking in the wind, held the position of a supposedly deceased Princess of the Empire. As for a title that could spice up the story, hers was more than flashy enough.</p>
<p class="block_2">After responding in that way, fearing his words might have truly angered Priscilla, Subaru’s heart had lurched. However, that was a needless fear―― Nay, it was far from a needless fear.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “――No doubt about that.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Saying so, Priscilla brought the tip of her fan to her lips and smiled.</p>
<p class="block_2">Just like a girl in the midst of chatting with her friends, she smiled in a relaxed manner.</p>
<p class="block_12">△▼△▼△▼△</p>
<p class="block_2">Somehow losing the chance to part ways, Subaru continued to walk around with Priscilla through the Fortified City.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru had worked far too hard during the current day, by his own admission, and the same could be said for Priscilla and the many others who continued to move energetically around the city.</p>
<p class="block_2">Of course, most of them, like Subaru, were probably in too high spirits to sleep.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Don’t tell me that they’re all undead who don’t know what it means to be tired…”</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “――What stupid things are you talking about?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Woahoa!?”</p>
<p class="block_2">In a daze, he looked out over the stone walkway to the cityscape below, where his comments were overheard by the people passing by.</p>
<p class="block_2">Moreover, someone whom he did not want to overhear him―― glaring at Subaru, was Rem.</p>
<p class="block_2">With a pail of water in her hands, Rem seemed to be one of the people who could not sleep either.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “So, are you still assisting in treating the injured? I know you’re working hard, but working too hard isn’t good either. You should learn from Nee-sama, who takes a rest as soon as she gets tired.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “I could say the same for you. No, rather, if you don’t have work to do, isn’t it your job to return to your room and quietly rest?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “What a shrewd argument…! I mean, it may not be a job, but there are things that I also have to do.”</p>
<p class="block_2">In a whispered voice, Subaru answered Rem, pointing his fingers together in front of his chest. Rem’s pale-blue eyes turned stern at his attitude, and Subaru’s courage waned more and more.</p>
<p class="block_2">Then, as if reaching out a helping hand to Subaru―― nay, simply to express her displeasure at the sight, Priscilla sighed,</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “It is no great matter. As you can see, his arms and legs are slightly longer than what they were in the form of a child. Because of this, it is difficult for him to face those whom he was involved with as a child.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “It’s redundant for my legs to still be short after I got bigger! You’re right about both things, though!”</p>
<p class="block_2">When Priscilla nonchalantly expressed those sentiments, Subaru bit his sleeve and sounded a “Gaa!”.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru had an important task ahead of him―― to tell everyone in the Pleiades Battalion that he had returned to his original form, just as Priscilla had said.</p>
<p class="block_2">Although Subaru’s comrades had been with him since his stay at Gladiator Island, he had never once confided to them that he had been in a shrunken form. In fact, he had never revealed the truth about being the illegitimate child of Abel, the Emperor, which meant that he had been lying all this time.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “If I reveal it and everyone despises me, I’ll never recover… I’d rather Natsuki Schwartz to have died an honorable death in battle…!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “If you tell a lie like that, I will despise you. Are you fine with being despised by me?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “I’d hate that as well. I wouldn’t be able to live if you hated me, Rem…!”</p>
<p class="block_2">His heart battered with Rem at the front gate and his Battalion at the rear gate, Subaru whined. Rem sighed at the situation and suddenly noticed Priscilla’s gaze on her.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla, with arms crossed to emphasize her breasts, called out “Rem” to her,</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Your expression has changed during our time apart. The healing magic that had caused you such anguish seems to be of some use.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “Yes, I have had many opportunities to practice what you told me, Priscilla-san… Also, thank you. That gentle fire that shared your strength with all of us after the star was shot down… that was something from Priscilla-san, right?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Hmm. What makes you believe that?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “――It’s intuition. Maybe it’s because of the time I spent with you, Priscilla-san, even if it was only for a short time.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Pulling the water pail closer to her chest, Rem replied to Priscilla.</p>
<p class="block_2">Despite her words, Rem’s smile was full of confidence, bringing a selfsame smile to Priscilla upon sighting it.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Very well. It seems that your heart of diamond has been pierced. I deliver mine praise.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Um, well, Rem, actually, when the city was in danger, that star thing, it was me and Beako who shot it down, what do you think about that? Well?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “Hah?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “I’m sorry for butting in I apologize so please just praise Beako later.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Wanting to be praised as much as Priscilla did, Rem gave him a scornful glare. Subaru was reluctant to back down, but Priscilla had a point.</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem seemed to stand tall now, to the point that the expression “heart of diamond” was apt. He thought that her reunion with Ram, Petra, and everyone else, coupled with the presence of her friend Katya, had had a big part in that.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Besides that, you can tell me more about what you and Priscilla were doing while I was gone.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “…More or less, once everything is taken care of.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Ah, in that case, I’ll help you treat the injured and anything else. You can let me carry that, too.”</p>
<p class="block_2">It was not his intention to put off talking to everyone in the Battalion, but it would be unthinkable to leave the busy Rem alone, even if he were tired.</p>
<p class="block_2">When Subaru offered, Rem said, “In that case”, and offered him the pail of water. However――</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “――No. It’s fine after all.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Huh!? D-did I do something to offend you!? Am I being too considerate, am I being unpleasant!?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “It’s not quite that. Not that, but… it’s because, if you come with me, Priscilla-san will be alone.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Nonono, in that case why don’t you let Priscilla help you treat the injured?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “Are you sane?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “I know you’re exaggerating, but what I said wasn’t a statement of sanity!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru reflected on the unbelievable things he was seeing. However, it was strange that Rem had refused his help because of Priscilla.</p>
<p class="block_2">In the first place, the fact that Subaru happened to be with Priscilla now was just by chance, not for any deep reason.</p>
<p class="block_2">If Beatrice and Spica would have kept him company, his night would not have turned out like this.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “But, Beako and Spica both got held up by experts in Spirit and Authority-related matters…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “Then, in that case, I’ll stay with Priscilla-san――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Rem, there is no need for such idiotic consideration. I can manage to walk around with the likes of this foolish commoner.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “See, I know it’s weird to say this, but you’re the one who started dragging me around in the first place!”</p>
<p class="block_2">He had been taken out to play the role of a jester, and thus ended up a certain clown exclaiming as such.</p>
<p class="block_2">However, Rem ignored Subaru’s plea and stared directly at Priscilla. Rem was still searching for the words that were not formed even in her mind,</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “I don’t want you to be alone, Priscilla-san.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “――So that was your answer that emerged after some time? You are a girl who does not understand.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “But now, this pain in my chest, it doesn’t hurt anymore, thanks to you.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem’s response was something that Subaru did not understand.</p>
<p class="block_2">Perhaps it was part of an exchange between Rem and Priscilla that Subaru did not know about. Upon receiving it, Priscilla paused for a beat, gave a small snort, and,</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Strive well, Rem. O daughter of the Oni―― For there are roles that only you can carry out, wishes that only you can grant, and a future that only you can achieve.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “――Priscilla-san?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Come, foolish commoner. Since Rem requested it, I shall take you with me especially.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “I’m not really satisfied with that, but, where to?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Ignoring Subaru’s convenience with dignity, Priscilla indicated the outside of the corridor with her fan. It was not the view below that Subaru had seen, nor the starry night sky, but something in between―― the walls.</p>
<p class="block_2">The city walls had all been damaged in the siege, though fortunately, they had retained their original form. However, they did not seem to be a place where anyone or anything was to be found.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Rem, follow thy own heart. For although your heart may ripple, those ripples shall never be unseemly.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Rem: “――Thank you.”</p>
<p class="block_2">After indicating their destination, Rem and Priscilla once again spoke of something Subaru did not understand.</p>
<p class="block_2">However, Rem’s calm expression gave Subaru no reason to dig any deeper.</p>
<p class="block_12">△▼△▼△▼△</p>
<p class="block_2">It appeared that people had finished clearing out, as there were not even any soldiers keeping watch atop the ramparts.</p>
<p class="block_2">Taking into account that the battle against the Great Disaster had only recently reached its finale, as well as the fact that the undead had yet to be fully exterminated, the decision seemed to be more than a tiny bit incautious――</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “Then, it boils down to who in the world’s got the guts to go against the Princess’s orders.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Greeting Subaru and Princess as such, Al sat atop the empty rampart, his legs crossed. Next to him was what appeared to be an expensive bottle of alcohol, and two glasses.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “You got drunk to celebrate us winning the war?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Don’t be stupid, no way I’d start without the Princess. That said, I didn’t think you’d be with her, bro. Ain’t that, like, a super rare pairing?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Everyone we’ve come across’s been saying that, it’s been pretty darn embarrassing this whole time.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al had proclaimed himself to not be inebriated; however, the tone of his voice was lively. Rather than due to the alcohol’s effects, perhaps he was slightly intoxicated due to the afterglow of their victory.</p>
<p class="block_2">As a matter of fact, while walking around town with Priscilla, Subaru had also felt that quite keenly.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “It’s not just that everyone’s got something to do, but they also really don’t want to let this be just a dream.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Quite the poet now, bro. But, I guess you don’t know. It’s more like, «O morning, please don’t arrive yet».”</p>
<p class="block_2">Everyone, rather than harboring the negative thought of going to sleep while holding the fear that their triumph would be naught but a dream upon waking up, probably held feelings more in line with wishing for the day of the victory that all of them had come together to seize to not come to an end.</p>
<p class="block_2">As Subaru and Al shared in that sentimentality before daybreak, the backs of their heads were suddenly tapped by a folding fan. As both screamed out “Gian!” in unison and turned around, they crossed gazes with Priscilla’s look of dumbfoundment.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “A clown and a commoner have gathered, discussing naught but foolish matters. More importantly… Al, have you procured what I sought in accordance with mine instructions?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Oh? Oh yeah, you don’t gotta worry. I requested that old Prime Minister geezer to clear the guards from the wall, and got some alcohol from the pretty High Countess. This booze man, its price’d prolly make my eyeballs pop outta my head if I happened to see what it is.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “I get you. The label and antiquity of the bottle give a sense of its price. I don’t drink alcohol, though.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “I get you. The box it was kept in did a really good job. I also don’t really drink, though.”</p>
<p class="block_2">As companions in their ignorance of alcohol, Subaru and Al amused themselves by pointing several things out. At their attitude, Priscilla shrugged her shoulders, and in their stead, took the bottle and removed the cork in a gesture she was accustomed to.</p>
<p class="block_2">Then, she slowly poured the liquid, pregnant with the sweet scent of liquor, into the two glasses.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “There are only two glasses. You two ought to share a single one.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Ah, I was sorta hoping for an indirect <i class="calibre4">seppun</i><sup class="calibre5"><a class="calibre2" href="index_split_032.html#note_40" id="back_note_40" title="40">40</a></sup> with the Princess if possible, but pardon me I apologize I’ll shut up.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al backed down dejectedly, but Subaru, being someone who understood the feelings of wanting to make teasing remarks, did not blame him. In any case, as Priscilla placed her own glass to her lips, Subaru, who was to her side, hesitated for a moment, and then placed his lips to the glass he had been given.</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Woah, underage drinking.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “It’s legal in this world… <i class="calibre4">Ghehough gahgk</i>!!”</p>
<p class="block_2">The liquor flowed onto his tongue, and the instant on which the scent passed through his nostrils and throat, Subaru choked up. As Al burst out laughing “Bwahaha” at that, he too took the glass from Subaru and sipped the alcohol.</p>
<p class="block_2">Using the hand holding the glass to lift the jaw of the helmet, he poured the liquor in through the gap, and then――</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “<i class="calibre4">Ghehough gaheugh ghbleughhh</i>!!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Aren’t you choking up more than I did!? Pull yourself together, fully fledged of-age drinker!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “You both are causing a racket. That defeated Witch ought to be bemoaning, you do not even know what fine liquor is.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “I’m getting some confusing feelings of guilt, please stop…”</p>
<p class="block_2">There was no way Sphinx would ever say “Apology: Required” due to something like being unable to taste the high-grade alcohol of victory, but Subaru was disheartened due to feeling like she would.</p>
<p class="block_2">In the end, as Subaru and Al shared their alcohol little-by-little, Priscilla finished emptying half of the bottle by herself. Specifically how strong it was was unknown, but for someone who had drunk that much alcohol, and alcohol that did feel quite strong at that, Priscilla’s face was as if it was nothing at all.</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “The Princess being a heavy drinker; right in line with her image, ain’t it?”</p>
<p class="block_2">To the somewhat prideful Al, Subaru did not respond that such was exactly the case. And, once the glass that Subaru and Al had been responsible for was emptied, Priscilla, as if deciding that this was the time to do something,</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Dawn is nigh. I am a tad amused―― Al, accompany mineself.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “<i class="calibre4">Kehough</i>… Huh? Accompany you, what do you… Uoh!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Declaring so, Priscilla put aside the half-emptied bottle of alcohol onto the handrail, took Al’s hand to help him stand up, and beckoned him to the middle of the wall’s top.</p>
<p class="block_2">Pulling the perplexed Al towards herself, she smiled at Subaru, who was gazing in wonder at what was happening,</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Natsuki Subaru, sing.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “That’s way too unreasonable of a request!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Your tongue ought to have been moistened by such high-quality liquor. Well, I shall just tell Rem in case you are of no use.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Grrrr, damn coward…! Fine!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Finding himself in a development against his will, Subaru folded his arms, and constructed a set list within his mind. As he did so, Al stared deeply into Priscilla’s eyes,</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Princess, I’m lacking one arm, y’know?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “So what of it. You have two legs and loyalty pledged to mineself―― Let us begin.”</p>
<p class="block_2">It was not as though that had been the signal, yet Priscilla’s words overlapped with the first bar of melody.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">What Subaru had chosen was not a hit song hailing from his original world, but one rooted in this other world, a tune that also happened to be a favorite of Subaru’s.</p>
<p class="block_2">The Sword Demon Love Song was a bit too long, and he would probably start crying while singing it.</p>
<p class="block_2">So, the song Subaru had chosen was――</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “――Sky that Transcends the Light of Dawn.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Slowly, the night over the Vollachian Empire would come to a close, and, pushing aside a yesterday speckled with stars, a new today boisterously dawned near.</p>
<p class="block_2">As a song that blessed that phenomenon, this was an absolute favorite of favorites among the tunes Subaru had heard in this world.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Fu.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Devoid of any instrumentation, the only thing producing sound was Subaru’s a cappella singing.</p>
<p class="block_2">When compared with the bard Liliana, who made music her livelihood, he fell well short. Yet that which served as the greatest praise towards Subaru as he sang, was Priscilla’s response of dance.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “There, dance your heart out, Al! Do not bore mineself!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Ehhh, shit! Now I’m in trouble! Bro! Turn up the <i class="calibre4">haku</i><sup class="calibre5"><a class="calibre2" href="index_split_032.html#note_41" id="back_note_41" title="41">41</a></sup>!”</p>
<p class="block_2">――While listening to Subaru’s singing voice, Priscilla and Al danced all around the rampart.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla’s dance was gorgeous; though she would likely become incensed were Subaru to say it, her dance was selfsame to the one performed by Abel back in Guaral with the purpose of seducing Zikr. Al’s awkward moves somewhat appeared to be those of a dance one would see at a lantern festival<sup class="calibre5"><a class="calibre2" href="index_split_032.html#note_42" id="back_note_42" title="42">42</a></sup>. Though lacking skill, it was fun to watch him.</p>
<p class="block_2">More than anything, it was clear that both Priscilla and Al, that master and servant both, were enjoying themselves.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru was supposed to have been doing this reluctantly, but before he realized, he was singing with a smile on his face.</p>
<p class="block_2">Sky that Transcends the Light of Dawn―― a song that sang about an inevitable dawn, a blessing upon a world born anew after being scorched by its brilliance, a song that was, in a sense, quite fitting for Vollachia, a nation ruled by flame.</p>
<p class="block_2">And, Priscilla, who lived like a flame, was a woman most alike Vollachia.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Ignorant as to how to end the song, he ended up repeating it, repeating twice, thrice even. As he sang, the dance between the two began to flow smoothly, and he lost the cue to bring it to its conclusion once more. Thus it repeated.</p>
<p class="block_2">As they were all enjoying themselves in that manner, the real morning sun began to softly illuminate the rampart.</p>
<p class="block_2">He had some alcohol in his system, and today―― no, yesterday, he had worked far too hard. Definitely, once he did go to sleep today, he would be incapable of waking up.</p>
<p class="block_2">Amidst the gleaming dazzle of the morning sun, Priscilla looked awfully bright as she danced with Al――</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “――Princess?”</p>
<p class="block_2">A sudden, an oh so sudden utterance came from Al.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Just priorly, the utterance would have been permeated with the high spirits he held no pretensions of hiding, with the yearning he held no capability of hiding. Now enlaced with a different timbre, Subaru’s singing came to an abrupt halt.</p>
<p class="block_2">Then, Subaru blinked; many times, many times he rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p class="block_2">And despite him rubbing his eyes――</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “――Albeit not on the level of that Songstress, Liliana Masquerade, it was not a poor performance.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Indeed, settled in Al’s chest while being embraced by him from behind, Priscilla voiced her praise.</p>
<p class="block_2">――With the morning sun shining through Priscilla’s body, she was faintly fading away.</p>
<p class="block_12">△▼△▼△▼△</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Aghast atop the ramparts of the Fortified City, enshrouded in the morning mist, Subaru gazed at Priscilla.</p>
