<p class="block_2">A blood-red dress, orange hair that reflected the rays of the sun, crimson eyes akin to flame―― all were things that composed the existence of Priscilla Barielle, none of those had changed, and yet.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “<i class="calibre4">Phri… ssilla</i>…?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “You too ought to know this already. In order to show me the Empire’s ruin, mine enemy, Sphinx, had imprisoned me within an alternate plane. In order to exit from therein, there was naught a choice but to reduce it to cinders.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “――Ah.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla was clever. Therefore, going off of nothing but Subaru’s trembling voice, she had understood what Subaru had been thinking, what Subaru had wanted to ask, and thus presented an answer to Subaru’s query.</p>
<p class="block_2">With that clear and concise response of hers, Subaru understood. He had ended up understanding.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">She was the same as Eugard Vollachia, the Emperor of yore who had been accompanied by Yorna.</p>
<p class="block_2">In exchange for her own life, Priscilla Barielle had returned from that alternate dimension.</p>
<p class="block_2">The reason why her figure was pierced by the light of the morning sun, becoming misty as it faded away, ephemerally so, was as clear as day.</p>
<p class="block_2">――The Priscilla Barielle present here, was already nothing more than an undead.</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “What… what sort of idiotic bullshit are you on about!!?”</p>
<p class="block_2">With Subaru unable to say anything, standing stock still in a daze, Al was the one to shout in his stead.</p>
<p class="block_2">Embracing Priscilla from behind, his voice trembling to an extent that it was clear that his face was contorting within his helmet, he tightly, tightly held onto her with his single right arm.</p>
<p class="block_2">So as to not relinquish Priscilla, being killed by the slow, unhalted rise of the morning sun.</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “No, no, you’re wrong, Princess, this sorta thing… B-BRO!!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “――! Right. Right, you’re wrong, you’re mistaken. Just wait, Priscilla, I’ll…”</p>
<p class="block_2">At Al’s quavering appeal, Subaru suddenly lifted his head and shifted his gaze towards the banister.</p>
<p class="block_2">The Great Disaster having come to a close, he had ended up spitting out the package of poison which he had kept behind his molar. So if he were to choose a method to redo things immediately, jumping off of the rampart would be the fastest――</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Cease.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “Why would I cease!? I have no reason to do that! This sort of thing, for me…!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “――Cease, Natsuki Subaru.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Just as he was about to jump over the railing, throwing himself over the edge, Subaru was held back by a voice. But, paying no heed to that, Subaru had fully settled his mind to proceed, to challenge the Great Disaster once more.</p>
<p class="block_2">And despite that――</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “The Authorities held by yourself and Al may possess the power to warp even the laws of fate. But, you ought to remember this. Regardless of what use you make of your powers and prayers, there are some who desire that things remain unchanged.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “What… What, the hell do you think you’re saying? This… this isn’t the time for that! Right now I need to――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Natsuki Subaru.”</p>
<p class="block_2">As Subaru grit his teeth, the nails of his hands upon the railing chipped off, blood streaming down.</p>
<p class="block_2">He ought to just ignore everything and anything that Priscilla was saying, and jump. Indeed, having expended his life time and time again against the Great Disaster, as one who had seized victory for the Empire, Subaru’s heart was screaming.</p>
<p class="block_2">But, perhaps he ought to be strong enough to brush that outcry to the wayside, and listen to what Priscilla had to say.</p>
<p class="block_2">As Subaru arrested all movement due to the clash within him, his cold logic at odds with his emotions, Al screamed out with a “Bro!”. Holding onto Priscilla as to absolutely never let go, trembling like a child throwing a tantrum,</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Bro! Please… Please!! Don’t listen to anything! You don’t need to listen to her! Do it! Save the Princess… SAVE PRISCILLA!!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Aldebaran.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “――Hk, stop, stop it, Priscilla! I ain’t gonna listen!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Shrieking in sorrow, Al was called to by Priscilla as he implored Subaru, the former shaking his head in denial.</p>
<p class="block_2">As she softly caressed his neck, Priscilla called Al by a name that Subaru was familiar with; however, this was his first time hearing it being used in regards to Al.</p>
<p class="block_2">Being embraced tightly from behind, caressing the neck of the man behind her, it held the impression akin to that of a painting―― as something so fleeting that it would not remain a reality for long, a painting was the exact impression it gave.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “The two of you have saved the Empire. Of course, there were others who also fought valiantly. Yet, there exists not a single other person who has expended anything on the realm you two have. I bestow mine praise upon that.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Thus, with a smile so beautiful as to reach unpleasantness, Priscilla continued.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru’s appeals, Al’s screams, neither of them had been able to stop Priscilla’s gently recited words.</p>
<p class="block_2">Those crimson lips, as if burning away the impressions of Priscilla that had persisted in him until now, as if to sear in that she had always been that way from the start, scorched their hearts with a flame known as convenient, rapturous beauty.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “The both of you have arrived at this junction by doing so many a time, this I know. Never placing yourselves above others, you have lived till today. Hence, it may be that neither of you has ever received due recompense. I shall thus bestow that upon you.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Saying that, within Priscilla’s crimson eyes, opened anew, Subaru was reflected. Then――</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “――It was a great service, Natsuki Subaru. Thou art a true Knight.”</p>
<p class="block_2">That instant he was granted that comment, strength vanished from Subaru’s knees.</p>
<p class="block_2">Subaru: “――Ah.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Falling to his knees, Subaru could no longer stand back up. His lips trembled all over, his mind was thrown into a disorderly state of chaos with all kinds of emotions, his understanding could not catch up.</p>
<p class="block_2">That notwithstanding, the reason as to which strength departed his knees, was because it had been made certain to him―― His soul, had understood.</p>
<p class="block_2">Natsuki Subaru could not save Priscilla Barielle.</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Aldebaran, thou as well…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “I told you to stop! I won’t fucking back down! There’s no way I can back down! Because… because that’s how it should be, right!? If… if I back down, you’ll… Princess, you’ll…!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Averting his gaze from Subaru, the latter having fallen to his knees, Al yet clung onto Priscilla. No longer was he turning to Subaru for help; rather, strenuously, he bellowed for her fate to be altered.</p>
<p class="block_2">Yet, his voice gradually was bereft of its vigor, the sound of him weakly sniveling many times resounding. Gazing upon Al, unable to resume his words any further, Priscilla smiled. Akin to a loving mother.</p>
<p class="block_2">Ironically enough, that smile was very much like Yorna’s, ergo serving as proof of their relationship as mother and daughter. Then, as if soothing her own weeping child, Priscilla spoke,</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Well, what am I to do about the likes of a grown man bawling at me like a child?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “――Hk.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “Ha ha ha, there there, I can hear it, thy crying, groveling voice saying thou want mineself to be thy bride.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “…Mhm.”</p>
<p class="block_2">At the laughing Priscilla’s sentence, in a hoarse voice Al replied, and nodded. As he did, embracing Priscilla’s frame even more tightly, as to not let go of that which already was difficult to let go of, he confessed.</p>
<p class="block_2">That was, undoubtedly, that was――</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Mhm, please be mine, Princess. My… Princess…”</p>
<p class="block_2">That was, regardless of what was said by anybody else, a confession of love indisputable.</p>
<p class="block_2">With all of the affection packed into his body, the man conveyed his love in its entirety to the woman within his arm. Receiving that, Priscilla’s crimson eyes flickered,</p>
<p class="block_2">Priscilla: “――Look at that, it is mine victory again<sup class="calibre5"><a class="calibre2" href="index_split_032.html#note_43" id="back_note_43" title="43">43</a></sup>.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Having made him declare it, the nature of Priscilla’s smile altered, morphing into that which was habitual.</p>
<p class="block_2">This was Priscilla Barielle; a triumphant expression brimming with confidence and pride, the lack of any hesitation to declare all things in this world as her own, a beauty who painted the very picture of arrogance.</p>
<p class="block_3" id="calibre_pb_46">Her radiance scorching the eyes of all, the Sun Princess whose presence could not help but make itself known to others――</p>
