<p class="block_">Priscilla:</p>
<p class="block_22"> </p>
<p class="block_">“You had best remember this, you who have decided to carry «heroic reveries» upon your backs, possessing the means to defy predetermined fate.”</p>
<p class="block_">“From here on, you shall bear the wounds of many, share in their pain, sniveling tears in their stead. However, many of those you are to happen across shan’t be virtuous. They shan’t even be upright―― Nor shall they be perfect.”</p>
<p class="block_">“There shall be days upon which you shan’t be able to accept yourselves, in regret of your own actions. There shall be nights upon which you shall bend at the knee, in lament for your own decisions. There shall be mornings upon which you shan’t be able to raise your visage, in opposition to your own wishes.”</p>
<p class="block_">“The unlovable sides to those you love, the loveable sides to those you cannot love, many a time shall you witness those, and end up treading the selfsame missteps―― And on those occasions, do remember.”</p>
<p class="block_23" id="calibre_pb_47">“That you both were praised by the perfect woman known as mineself, known as Priscilla Barielle.”</p>
