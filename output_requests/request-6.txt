<p class="block_2">Even if doused in water, the flames shan’t fade. Even were he to try to spread the fire elsewhere, the flames shan’t spread. Even were the point of flames’ genesis lopped off, the rest of his body would immediately be ignited by the inescapable flames of terminus―― indeed, this was his terminus.</p>
<p class="block_2">He had a feeling. He knew. This blaze shan’t fade. Until he met his end, it shan’t fade.</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “Ahh, ahhh, AHHHH, what the hell…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Going so far as to descend to the body of an undead by his own blade, he had attempted to master the way of the sword.</p>
<p class="block_2">The flame of the Yang Sword, which he had encountered upon his journey to reach the final destination of that path, had set a conflagration upon the soul of Rowan Segmunt, the man who had a burning desire for the Heavenly Sword, attempting to scorch his entirety to naught.</p>
<p class="block_2">Refusing to remain in that place, Rowan had fled the battlefield, and broken into a mad dash.</p>
<p class="block_2">His leg crumbled as he stepped forth, so if the next step would result in the loss of his entire lower half, he would lop off his own head as to not needlessly waste time, and thus the next step of his remains would be taken by his next self.</p>
<p class="block_2">Repeating this process, Rowan ran―― He distanced himself from the Emperor of the Briar, in order to reach the place he was obliged to reach before he was burnt to a crisp.</p>
<p class="block_2">Rowan: “What the hell… Just as expected, I have it.”</p>
<p class="block_2">As embers emanated from all over his body, a vividly gruesome smile emerged on Rowan’s face.</p>
<p class="block_2">Having been reduced to an undead, Rowan had become acutely aware of the state of his own soul, and had placed the tips of his toes upon the steps to reach the Heavenly Sword. In order to reliably take the next steps higher, this was his next trial, indeed.</p>
<p class="block_2">Rowan’s soul would be scorched to oblivion in the not-so-distant future. But, the flame of a candle would always burn brightest right before it went out.</p>
<p class="block_2">――For Rowan Segmunt, reaching the Heavenly Sword was his life’s dearest wish.</p>
<p class="block_2">He had even proved that he would give up his life with no hesitation for that purpose.</p>
<p class="block_2">In truth, by experiencing death, and gaining awareness of the shape of his soul, Rowan had steadily gotten closer to achieving his wish.</p>
<p class="block_2">Thus, as long as Rowan reached the Heavenly Sword, it mattered not if he did so only for a single second.</p>
<p class="block_2">For a mere second before his soul was burnt to a crisp, even if it was for naught more than an instant, all that mattered was that he reached it.</p>
<p class="block_2">And what was needed to achieve that――</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “――Oya oya oya, I had thought somebody was furiously dashing here, but to think it would be a flaming entrance! My my, isn’t this quite the flashy production, if I do say so myself?”</p>
<p class="block_2">An audible voice; the place he had wanted to reach before being burnt to nihil.</p>
<p class="block_2">Beholding the owner of that voice beyond his burning field of vision, Rowan thanked his karma.</p>
<p class="block_2">He had arrived at the place he had wanted to reach. All that remained, was to reach <i class="calibre4">it</i>.</p>
<p class="block_2">Indeed, before Rowan as he gave a burning grin, the boy, holding a brown-skinned girl in his arms, smiled.</p>
<p class="block_2">As irony would naturally have it, the boy gave a smile that resembled Rowan’s own, and spoke.</p>
<p class="block_2">Boy: “Just now, you made me think this for the first time, dad―― I don’t dislike it, rather, I quite like it.”</p>
<p class="block_2">So he declared.</p>
