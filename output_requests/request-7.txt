<p class="block_2">――The person known as Rowan Segmunt, was a man completely unfit to be a father.</p>
<p class="block_2">Though Cecilus Segmunt thought that so-called common sensibilities were unnecessary for the leading actor, it was apparent that Rowan was a father far removed from the conventional family image.</p>
<p class="block_2">An ideal father was not someone who would slay his own child because it “didn’t seem” like they would grow up in the way he desired.</p>
<p class="block_2">A single-minded eccentricity divorced from all notions of paternal love, that was the entirety of the reason why Rowan had killed all of Cecilus’s older brothers while they were still infants.</p>
<p class="block_2">A swordsman in whom a genuine madness resided, such that he had no qualms with trampling upon anything as long as it was for the sake of reaching the Heavenly Sword―― Rowan Segmunt was nothing more, and nothing less, than precisely that.</p>
<p class="block_2">In all likelihood, Rowan would be deemed the foremost failure of a father even if one searched far and wide all throughout the world. Born into this world as the son of a father utterly lacking in such respect or familial love, Cecilus truly thought himself fortuitous from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p class="block_2">――The desire towards the Heavenly Sword harbored by Rowan, was something that Cecilus also harbored himself.</p>
<p class="block_2">That was an endeavor that aimed to tread into the far distance, to a region above the clouds unseen by the eye; by no means could it be achieved by somebody who diverted their gaze or took detours.</p>
<p class="block_2">Had he been raised in a family that was respectable and distinguished throughout history, had he been raised in a household of honorable poverty that hesitated to steal for the sake of a meal, Cecilus would not have had any conclusive evidence that his wish to reach the Heavenly Sword was not contaminated with needless impurities.</p>
<p class="block_2">Therefore, it was Rowan Segmunt.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cutting down all blood relations that served as obstructive fetters, removing all hindrances without hesitation in his pursuit to master the way of the sword with undaunted resolve, he prepared trial after trial with his son’s life as a secondary concern.</p>
<p class="block_2">That pure madness staked on the sword, free from any impurity, was unstintingly poured into Cecilus by Rowan.</p>
<p class="block_2">Hence, Cecilus thought.</p>
<p class="block_2">――As expected, he, born into this world as the son of Rowan, most definitely had it.</p>
<p class="block_12">△▼△▼△▼△</p>
<p class="block_2">Drawn from a scabbard of dreams, the Dream Sword flashed as it ran through the sky of reality――</p>
<p class="block_2">Cutting the explosion of light, which seemed to invite the destruction of the world, head-on, its tip was delivered to the beautiful girl who housed a blue flame in a single one of her eyes as she shed tears of blood.</p>
<p class="block_2">Basking in the supernatural stroke of the blade, the girl’s―― Arakiya’s slender body had its very life severed in twain; such a thing did not come to pass.</p>
<p class="block_2">The reason being, even the outcome from the slash of the Enchanted Sword, forged with reason not of this world, was something that did not adhere to common sense.</p>
<p class="block_2">――The Stone, Muspel.</p>
<p class="block_2">As one enrolled among the Four Greats, it was the Great Spirit that sustained the vast lands of the Vollachian Empire.</p>
<p class="block_2">Even if he intuitively understood that what he had exorcized with the Dream Sword Masayume was both Arakiya and not Arakiya, an extreme presence which had been painting over her very existence, Cecilus had no way of discerning its true identity.</p>
<p class="block_2">But then again, Cecilus’s resolve or actions would not have changed regardless if he had known.</p>
<p class="block_2">Even if he understood that the vast lands of the Empire would crumble together with the Great Spirit if Muspel were to be destroyed, it was inevitable that Cecilus would draw the Dream Sword.</p>
<p class="block_2">To prioritize the presence of the heroine over the vast lands of the Empire, was a natural decision for the leading actor.</p>
<p class="block_2">To begin with, when it came to the script, it was impossible that anything Cecilus carried out with conviction would result in a bad ending.</p>
<p class="block_2">Therefore――</p>
<p class="block_2">Arakiya: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Unable to endure the power she had taken into herself, Arakiya had been on the verge of bursting apart.</p>
<p class="block_2">Before Cecilus, having exorcized the gargantuan power that threatened her life with the Dream Sword, the innumerable bands of light encircling Arakiya―― those diamond bands were reduced to dazzling particles, melting into the crimson-tinted Imperial Capital.</p>
<p class="block_2">As Arakiya slowly fell in the midst of those dancing particles of light, Cecilus sheathed the Dream Sword into the scabbard, which had suddenly appeared on his waist like a dream itself, and reached out his hands.</p>
<p class="block_2">His body was covered in wounds. Having sustained lacerations all over his figure, his blood-drenched <i class="calibre4">kimono</i> was torn and frayed, his design was far too beaten-up to be called attire fit for a bout.</p>
<p class="block_2">However, contrary to that miserable appearance, the light in Cecilus’s eyes as he caught Arakiya had not clouded over in the slightest.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Languidly, the unconscious girl had both her eyes closed, and displayed a sleeping face that seemed as if she was dead.</p>
<p class="block_2">Since he knew that she was not actually dead from how she felt in his hands, he did not panic. Only, he quietly shrugged his shoulders as if to say “Good grief”.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “You really know how to cause a stir, Anya.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Among his faint memories that had been resuscitated in the midst of battle, the majority were of his evening conversation with the friend who had shrunk Before Cecilus into the form of After Cecilus. However, when excluding that majority, the one who had left the largest footprint on his memories was this girl.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus had a reputation, both among himself and others, that he was unable to look after others. Since he had made it so difficult to follow himself until here, there was no greater handful than her.</p>
<p class="block_2">Perhaps, it would have been no exaggeration to say that she was the biggest handful in the whole Empire.</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “…I guess it’s fine to assume you’ve wrapped things up?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Behind Cecilus as he held Arakiya, a voice with a slight sense of tension called out to him.</p>
<p class="block_2">Approaching with footsteps that emphasized his caution, and in a state of being equally as battered as Cecilus from the aftermath of the battle, was Al.</p>
<p class="block_2">Not only had he survived without being reduced to spent charcoal at the edge of the decisive battle of the bastion, but his act of playing supporting role by throwing his weapon at the end for Cecilus’s spotlight, was also something that clearly served as his own spotlight.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “That was quite the masterfully controlled performance, Al-san. I think understanding my intentions back there and throwing your weapon truly merits quite the high <i class="calibre4">ten</i><sup class="calibre5"><a class="calibre2" href="index_split_032.html#note_11" id="back_note_11" title="11">11</a></sup>.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “What kind of <i class="calibre4">ten</i>, as in favorability with you? In that case, I really don’t give a shit.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Drooping his shoulders in a fed-up manner, Al looked towards Arakiya and said “More importantly…”. His gaze through his iron helmet was filled with trepidation, giving off a nervous and fearful atmosphere, but.</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Lil’ Miss Arakiya is…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “Not dead. After all, in order to secure a conclusion where she wouldn’t die, I went through the trouble of tearing through my limits a second and then a third time. It would have been outrageous to stop her by killing her! It’s the way of Cecilus Segmunt to meet expectations, and betray tasteless predictions.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “…If you’re fine with not killing her, then I’m not gonna press you for that conclusion.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus puffed out his chest as he responded so, to which Al heaved a sigh as he fiddled with the metal fixtures of his helmet.</p>
<p class="block_2">Of course, Cecilus understood Al’s concerns. It was a matter of if the risk of letting Arakiya live was worth the trade-off for the sense of security that would have come with killing her. However――</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “If it’s going to be that kind of complex and unexciting discussion, feel free to have it with some wise person with a frowny face in a place where I’m not around. My answer is just as you see it, Al-san.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “…I already knew from the start that any persuasion or arguing with you would be a three-hit combo of unreasonable, impossible, and thoughtless. You’re gonna need to take responsibility for the lil’ miss.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “Apparently that was my intention from the beginning. Seems like since the very first time I defeated Anya, my intention was to shoulder that responsibility.”</p>
<p class="block_2">With a light feeling as if he was speaking of somebody else’s matters when they were in fact his own, Cecilus saw the face of Arakiya from when she was younger overlaid upon her sleeping face currently in his arms.</p>
<p class="block_2">Just like with the friend he had parted with amidst the evening sun, this was an illusion visible to him only because their acquaintance had been for so long. Perhaps he ought to put a bit more of his back into it, and tackle the memories which he had been far too concerned about pulling out.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “But it seems like there’s a separate duty that I need to carry out, before I can delve into that <i class="calibre4">souwa</i><sup class="calibre5"><a class="calibre2" href="index_split_032.html#note_12" id="back_note_12" title="12">12</a></sup>.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Ah?”</p>
<p class="block_2">As Cecilus suddenly muttered, Al raised his voice in surprise. But, Cecilus did not respond with words, and instead left his answer to the act of directing his gaze in another direction.</p>
<p class="block_2">In the aftermath of his battle with Arakiya, the buildings and streets had all melted, leaving the Imperial Capital in a hellish state, dyed red―― within that scene, the malevolent madness of an appropriate figure had arisen.</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">With an inextinguishable flame flaring about his entire body, a blue-haired man stood.</p>
<p class="block_2">His skin was scorched black, hiding one of its characteristics, but the blazing radiance of his golden eyes would have made it apparent to everyone that this man was an undead nevertheless.</p>
<p class="block_2">And to Cecilus, a fact greater than what would have been communicated to everyone else was made apparent.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “――Oya oya oya, I had thought somebody was furiously dashing here, but to think it would be a flaming entrance! My my, isn’t this quite the flashy production, if I do say so myself?”</p>
<p class="block_2">He had not been running around haphazardly, rather, he had been running with a clear objective in mind.</p>
<p class="block_2">The fact that his hurried strides had ceased at this place, was because that objective resided here―― nay, that objective resided within none other than Cecilus Segmunt.</p>
<p class="block_2">――With sights set upon the Heavenly Sword, the swordsman who neglected all else, Rowan Segmunt.</p>
<p class="block_2">Having finally cast away even his own life, his father had arrived here in a completely altered form, to which Cecilus nodded many times in acknowledgement, and smiled.</p>
<p class="block_2">Rowan was grinning in the midst of being engulfed in a blaze. Cecilus, too, smiled in his blood-drenched form.</p>
<p class="block_2">The parent and the child, for whom naught was possible save for living and dying by the sword, grinning and smiling――</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “Just now, you made me think this for the first time, dad―― I don’t dislike it, rather, I quite like it.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Saying that, and ironically forgetting about the After Cecilus, he celebrated that the chance to fulfill the promise exchanged by the Before Cecilus had finally come about.</p>
<p class="block_12">△▼△▼△▼△</p>
<p class="block_2">――Rowan Segmunt longed for the Heavenly Sword.</p>
<p class="block_2">Why? For what reason? For what purpose?</p>
<p class="block_2">He was tired of hearing such tedious questions. That whole kit and caboodle was nonsense that had nothing to do with Rowan.</p>
<p class="block_2">Its impetus went beyond his earliest memories, its genesis was consigned to the riverbed of oblivion.</p>
<p class="block_2">Since the very first occasion he had laid fingers upon steel in the form of a sword, there no longer remained any other path for Rowan Segmunt but to master the art of swinging it.</p>
<p class="block_2">Even after being endowed with a commandment as a Stargazer, and gaining a son to serve as a vessel to reach the Heavenly Sword, Rowan had continued to do nothing but commit himself to diligent study so that he himself could reach the Heavenly Sword.</p>
<p class="block_2">Even using the fact that his greatest enemy in reaching the Heavenly Sword had been brought forth into this world by his own hands, he committed himself to diligent study, with diligent study, of diligent study, for diligent study, he diligently studied――</p>
<p class="block_2">Rowan: “Ahhh… the time for my grand moment, has arrived at last.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Soul aflame, life fading to ash, his very destiny was on the cusp of its terminus.</p>
<p class="block_2">All were engulfed in the blaze, and as Rowan’s self was blurring into the realm after death, he entered into a domain untread by living and undead both―― the interval between life and death, the point that ought to be called the beyond.</p>
<p class="block_2">That was tantamount to uncovering the very nature, the true essence, of life and the soul.</p>
<p class="block_2">A few more seconds, real as they might be, the final significance of Rowan Segmunt’s existence would overflow.</p>
<p class="block_2">Rowan: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Each time his undead body crumbled, he readied his beloved <i class="calibre4">katana</i>, continuously resurrected alongside himself, and faced forward.</p>
<p class="block_2">The small figure visible beyond the flickering flames, witnessing it take the exact same stance as himself――</p>
<p class="block_2">Rowan: “――Now, let us have ourselves…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “AN HONORABLE DUEL――!!”</p>
<p class="block_2">――Challenging the Heavenly Sword, the ephemeral flash of Rowan Segmunt blazed bright.</p>
<p class="block_12">△▼△▼△▼△</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “I’m leaving Anya in your care.”</p>
<p class="block_2">On the remains of the street that could no longer be called a road, answering the request of Rowan, who had appeared there in a blazing form, Cecilus forcibly foisted Arakiya upon Al.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus could hear Al’s bewildered voice go “Oioi!?” at the suddenness of it all, but he discarded that into the abyssal depths of his consciousness, and focused all of his nerves on a lone man.</p>
<p class="block_2">Once again, color, sound, and smell vanished from Cecilus’s world, and it became governed solely by the palpitations of steel.</p>
<p class="block_13">Rowan: “――Now, let us have ourselves…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Holding his hand over the <i class="calibre4">katana</i> at his waist, it was apparent that Rowan’s lips had moved to spin such words as he readied himself.</p>
<p class="block_2">Even if he could not hear it in the form of sound, the sentiments between the parent and child who loved extravagant pretenses had allowed him to hear it within his soul.</p>
<p class="block_2">Hence, Cecilus likewise responded with grandeur.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “AN HONORABLE DUEL――!!”</p>
<p class="block_2">In an instant, the distance separating the two disappeared.</p>
<p class="block_2">That was nothing out of the ordinary for a battle involving Cecilus, Blue Lightning as he was, but this moment was not created by just Cecilus alone, and it was evidence that Rowan had stepped past the confines of human capability.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “I’m surprised.”</p>
<p class="block_2">This was honest admiration.</p>
<p class="block_2">A few hours prior, when he had parted with the yet-living Rowan, as far as Cecilus’s eyes could see, his father had not reached this domain. However, now that they had been reunited, with him having become an undead, Rowan’s skill with the sword had rapidly developed, and his talents were finally beginning a posthumous bloom.</p>
<p class="block_2">That was neither something like his speed nor the proficiency of his skills, but it was a transformation brought about by a change in his consciousness.</p>
<p class="block_2">The effect that mentality could have on performance was nothing to make light of, but having said that, breaking out of one’s mental shell would not dramatically improve their physical abilities. Hence, the transformation within Rowan was not one of extreme physical nature.</p>
<p class="block_2">――Rowan had become capable of taking himself “one step” further.</p>
<p class="block_2">That which was not a physical step, was difficult to describe on a level above that of pure feeling. Just as there was a great distance between amateurs and experts, there existed yet another gap between first and second-class experts.</p>
<p class="block_2">Thus, between first-class and super first-class, and between them and the transcendent beings that were even further above, there existed more gaps.</p>
<p class="block_2">Invisible to the eye, inexplicable with words, Cecilus had deliberately expressed that here with the phrase “one step”, and had recognized that Rowan had tread over that boundary.</p>
<p class="block_2">To think that through the experience of death, he had overcome that difference of a single step which he had never been able to cross over in his life.</p>
<p class="block_2">People would likely speak of how foolish, how incredibly ironic such a thing was. But, none other than Cecilus alone would――</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “I don’t dislike it, rather, I quite like it.”</p>
<p class="block_2">An unyielding flame upon his body, as his life itself was being scorched, Rowan, plunged into the realm of death as he was, unleashed a stroke of his sword; as the blade flashed across a world bereft of color and light, Cecilus watched in adoration.</p>
<p class="block_2">Within the glint of the blade there dwelled assiduous training, diligent study in which no corners had been cut; witnessing this, his eyes flickered.</p>
<p class="block_2">As a father, Rowan would likely be evaluated as the worst of the worst, and though Cecilus would not deny that, he dearly loved Rowan’s mentality of constantly pouring his entire soul into the role he played.</p>
<p class="block_2">Rowan: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Igniting the little life he had left as fuel, Rowan unleashed his greatest stroke of the sword in all of his time, during both his life and after his death.</p>
<p class="block_2">That brandish, honed to a razor’s edge, was pregnant with an aura of swordsmanship that caused even Cecilus to envision death―― That nightmarish ending, born out of a single-minded concentration, was something that the Dream Sword Masayume would not allow.</p>
<p class="block_2">The Fiend Sword Murasame was an Enchanted Sword that could sever the concept of anything’s “core”.</p>
<p class="block_2">In contrast, using dreams as its scabbard, the true value of the Dream Sword Masayume was――</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “――To devour dreams, and to grant dreams.”</p>
<p class="block_2">In exchange for the motivation one possessed for a wish they desired to be granted, the Enchanted Sword would harbor the power to grant that wish.</p>
<p class="block_2">Hence, the Dream Sword had been granted the name of “A Dream Come True<sup class="calibre5"><a class="calibre2" href="index_split_032.html#note_13" id="back_note_13" title="13">13</a></sup>”, making dreams become reality. Even if it were to become a useless, dull blade depending on the wielder, it had continued to be extolled as an Enchanted Sword capable of severing the very world in twain.</p>
<p class="block_2">The blade had spent many months and years being transferred from person to person, since as compensation for their wish being fulfilled, they would forget even the reason why they had yearned for it in the first place. Its owner having changed many a times, now, the Dream Sword had settled into Cecilus’s hand.</p>
<p class="block_2">For both Cecilus and the Dream Sword, this was a miraculous happenstance. That was because――</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “There’s no way that my dreams and <i class="calibre4">yaruki</i><sup class="calibre5"><a class="calibre2" href="index_split_032.html#note_14" id="back_note_14" title="14">14</a></sup> are ever going to run out!”</p>
<p class="block_2">That was the reason why Cecilus Segmunt was the master of the Dream Sword.</p>
<p class="block_2">An extraordinary yearning towards the dreams one harbored would allow the potential of the Dream Sword Masayume to be displayed to the maximum degree.</p>
<p class="block_2">――That instant, the unleashed brandish blurred the boundary between dream and reality as it sliced.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “――――”</p>
