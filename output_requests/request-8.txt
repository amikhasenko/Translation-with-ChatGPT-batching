<p class="block_2">Compared to the decisive battle of the bastion between Cecilus and Arakiya a moment prior, this bout was far too quiet.</p>
<p class="block_2">The impact bestowed upon the Imperial Capital, the Empire, and the world was insignificant; something like a one-on-one against an undead that would have disappeared either way, could not be anything but a trivial matter.</p>
<p class="block_2">However, for the parent and child duo that was Rowan Segmunt and Cecilus Segmunt, there was significance.</p>
<p class="block_2">Rowan: “…Ahhh, good grief, what an unfilial son I’ve got.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Passing by each other the moment their blades had crossed, the parent and child had their backs turned to each other.</p>
<p class="block_2">His undead father, whose face he would never be able to see again, unpleasantly spat that out in a long exhale, and then,</p>
<p class="block_2">Rowan: “If this is how it ends, I shoulda cut ya down right away back when ya were soaking in yer first bath.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “Hahahahaha! Yes, yes, that’s right! That’s the only time you would’ve been able to win, dad!”</p>
<p class="block_2">At the sore loser who acted truly dishonorably, Cecilus roared in a great burst of laughter.</p>
<p class="block_2">Hearing Cecilus’s unreserved laughter, Rowan looked up at the sky. Having lost its form, his <i class="calibre4">katana</i> was reduced to dust, and as his existence began to fray from his burning fingertips, he narrowed his golden eyes. And then――</p>
<p class="block_2">Rowan: “Next time, next―― I ain’t the kinda person who’d give up on account of dying.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Until the very end of the end, without leaving behind even a single word befitting a father, his body, his soul, was reduced to ash.</p>
<p class="block_2">Constantly aiming for the Heavenly Sword, and not relinquishing that desire even in death, those were the final moments of the malevolent swordsman known as Rowan Segmunt.</p>
<p class="block_12">△▼△▼△▼△</p>
<p class="block_2"><i class="calibre4">Ahhh, how unpleasant, how unpleasant</i>, Rowan thought as he faded away.</p>
<p class="block_2">Throughout his lifetime, he had continued to walk without halting his step, and ultimately, he had been unable to reach the Heavenly Sword.</p>
<p class="block_2">The final blaze of his scorched, burning soul had not illuminated the unseen path towards the pinnacle of the sword. How very, how so very tantalizing.</p>
<p class="block_2">At this rate, Cecilus would probably end up being the one to reach the Heavenly Sword.</p>
<p class="block_2">To think it would be his son instead of himself, what truly malicious discretion of the Sword God. Chagrin and despair, dejection and lament; if he were to start speaking, he would never be able to clear away the inexhaustible negative thoughts.</p>
<p class="block_2">Be that as it may――</p>
<p class="block_2">Rowan: “Well, guess it’s better than some other person reaching it.”</p>
<p class="block_2">In that final duel, if Rowan had surpassed Cecilus, would he have reached the Heavenly Sword?</p>
<p class="block_2">He had not surpassed him. In the end, it was meaningless to think about hypotheticals that had not come to pass. Rowan would not think about meaningless things. Especially when he was on the verge of fading away.</p>
<p class="block_2">He ought not do what should not be done, so when trying to think of other things, he came to a realization.</p>
<p class="block_2">Ever since he had been aware of his surroundings, he had aimed for the Heavenly Sword, in every waking moment, in every sleeping moment, he dreamed of nothing but reaching the Heavenly Sword, that was how the existence known as himself had persisted until this day.</p>
<p class="block_2">Once Rowan concluded that he would not reach the Heavenly Sword, there no longer remained anything for him to think about.</p>
<p class="block_2">Rowan: “Hm.”</p>
<p class="block_2">For the first time since he began longing for the Heavenly Sword, he relinquished it.</p>
<p class="block_2">That sensation made Rowan feel a sense of loss rather than a sense of freedom, as well as a certain kind of discomfort. Amidst the sensation of his soul feeling ill at ease, Rowan thought this for the very first time in his life.</p>
<p class="block_2">――<i class="calibre4">Was the blaze of my soul that I had spent my whole life to reach, at least able to become a flame for a candle that will illuminate my son’s path? </i>So he thought.</p>
<p class="block_12">△▼△▼△▼△</p>
<p class="block_2">Leaving behind naught but ash and dust, the figure of Rowan Segmunt faded away.</p>
<p class="block_2">Within his soul, Cecilus Segmunt understood that this undoubtedly signified the death of his father.</p>
<p class="block_2">Having already met his end as a mortal, Rowan had still continued to aim for the Heavenly Sword after being reduced to an undead, and as his life was on the cusp of burning out, Cecilus had certainly severed it in twain.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “Al-san, sorry for so suddenly entrusting you with Anya. It must not be easy to carry someone with only one arm so I’ll take her back now.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Returning Masayume to its sheath after it had completed its duty, Cecilus turned around and called out to Al.</p>
<p class="block_2">However, Al gave no response to that call. On one knee and supporting Arakiya’s body with one arm, as he shook his head side-to-side in a feeble manner,</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “How… are you so calm?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “And by that, you mean?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “You know what I mean! Just now, that was your own father, wasn’t it! He was still alive when you last saw each other, and yet he died and became a pawn of the enemy, that’s…!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “Wait wait, <i class="calibre4">yamete</i><sup class="calibre5"><a class="calibre2" href="index_split_032.html#note_15" id="back_note_15" title="15">15</a></sup> right there, Al-san. You’re a little mistaken so please allow me to correct you. My dad certainly became a dead person, but he hadn’t been made into a pawn. The reason why my dad attacked me wasn’t because he’d lost his sanity.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Wha…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “Ah, by the way, I said sanity with the widely-accepted meaning of the word so perhaps my dad was already quite divorced from that regular type of sanity. On that front, make no mistake, but…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Waving his hand, Cecilus added that bit regarding Rowan’s mentality.</p>
<p class="block_2">Either way, Cecilus wanted to clear up Al’s misunderstanding that this was an act of returning the favor for Rowan having attacked Cecilus, which happened because his mind had been destroyed after being turned into an undead.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “Stuff like a child killing their parent was also a <i class="calibre4">juuyou</i><sup class="calibre5"><a class="calibre2" href="index_split_032.html#note_16" id="back_note_16" title="16">16</a></sup> development in the play «Magrizza’s Guillotine»―― But then again, things between me and my dad turning out like this was something that had been appointed by fate quite a long time ago.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Appointed, by fate…?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “So, it’s simply a matter of that time finally having come around.”</p>
<p class="block_2">This was a conclusion that both Cecilus and Rowan knew would eventually come.</p>
<p class="block_2">Thus, when Rowan had returned as a dead person, despite having parted when he was still alive, Cecilus was not very surprised. For Rowan, everything outside of reaching the Heavenly Sword was trifle, so it was understandable that if necessary, he would sacrifice his own life as if it was the natural thing to do.</p>
<p class="block_2">Nobody was capable of understanding Rowan―― Nobody, except Cecilus.</p>
<p class="block_2">His father, who was exceedingly the best at being a bad example, was not an incomprehensible monster. That was sufficient proof that the Segmunts had a healthy parent-child relationship, even if an atypical one.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “Most people would probably disapprove of the relationship between me and my dad, but――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Unlike Rowan, Cecilus did not view all things in the world as trifle. So long as one could properly distinguish between the cheers and the other interference, the world was filled with blessings as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p class="block_2">The light of the sun, the cool breeze, the trickle of raindrops, the fragrance of grass, and Rowan Segmunt―― all were blessings that had been granted to Cecilus.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “My dad called me an unfilial son, but I don’t think there’s any son as filial as I am. After all, just by being my father, he has achieved the exceedingly meritorious achievement of having brought me into this world.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Of course, that would not serve as consolation to Rowan, who had failed to realize the wish he had pursued throughout his life.</p>
<p class="block_2">Being called an unfilial son for such a reason, Cecilus had no room for excuse. Though from the outset, he had no intention whatsoever of leading a life in need of excuses.</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Walking right up to the speechless Al, Cecilus folded his arms and tilted his head.</p>
<p class="block_2">After this, there was the worry of what should be done with Arakiya. Even if he tried to bring her somewhere safe, was there anywhere in the current Imperial Capital that actually was safe?</p>
<p class="block_2">Were there any safe zones aside from Cecilus’s direct vicinity?</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “Having said that it’d be a bit strange to carry Anya around the whole time as I run about… if we don’t head back soon then Groovy-san’s sure to loudly yell at us. He went off to go hold back the caster of that curse, and speaking of which, do you think Groovy-san will be okay with us coming back with the Dream Sword instead of the Fiend Sword?”</p>
<p class="block_2">From the start, the encounter with Arakiya was an unexpected combat.</p>
<p class="block_2">The reason that Cecilus and Al had come here was to search for the Fiend Sword Murasame, capable of cutting curses, and unfortunately they had not fulfilled that objective. By now, Groovy should have been doing battle with the caster of the troublesome Curse of Thorns.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “For the time being, how about it, Al-san. While you do your best to carry Anya here, I’ll clear the way ahead, by cooperating like that…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “――Nah, I can’t agree to that.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “Al-san?”</p>
<p class="block_2">At Cecilus’s proposition, Al shook his head side-to-side and declined. Standing up from his kneeling position, he foisted Arakiya back upon Cecilus.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus reflexively took Arakiya into his arms, and then,</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “I’ve said it before. I’ve got something that I gotta do. Lil’ Miss Arakiya was an unthinkable detour… Feel bad for Groovy, though.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Lowering the tone of his voice, Al’s gaze through his steel helmet was directed towards the Dream Sword on Cecilus’s waist.</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “Even I can tell that the <i class="calibre4">katana</i> on your waist is an insanely powerful weapon. It may be different from the one Groovy wanted, but do your best with it.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “So then Al-san is going off on his own. It may not be my place to say this, but will Al-san be alright walking around by himself unarmed? Wouldn’t dying in vain be the most you could do?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “――I won’t die in vain. That’s the one thing I’ll never do.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “Indeed, seems like it. I kinda understand somehow or another.”</p>
<p class="block_2">As Al spoke with conviction, Cecilus nodded in assent.</p>
<p class="block_2">Having acted together until here, Cecilus thought that Al possessed a special trait of the same kind as Schwartz’s “True Sight”. With that “True Sight”, capable of seeing excessively ahead, Al surely would not die in vain.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “But that’s not the only reason why Al-san is trying to part ways with me, right?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “It seems like you really weren’t pleased in the slightest with how me and my dad settled things. Perhaps Al-san also has some reservations regarding parent-child relationships?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “…That’s got nothing to do with this.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Even if it had nothing to do with this, Al’s tone made it clear that a nerve had been struck, so Cecilus slightly shrugged his shoulders, and adjusted his hold on Arakiya.</p>
<p class="block_2">Personally, Cecilus was reluctant to part with Al and leave him alone.</p>
<p class="block_2">Part of that was because he judged that it would not be ideal to have his hands full with Arakiya, but more so because of his debt to Al―― in order to finish things without letting Arakiya die, it was a fact that Cecilus had borrowed Al’s power.</p>
<p class="block_2">Long story short, Cecilus had to repay his debt to Al.</p>
<p class="block_2">If Al had someone he wanted to save, then it made sense for Cecilus to assist him in that rescue.</p>
<p class="block_2">Worst case scenario, he could knock out Al and carry him back to Groovy, and then after mowing down the problem entirely with a swing of the Dream Sword, everyone would go to meet Al’s “Princess”.</p>
<p class="block_2">It happened at the same moment he had thought that.</p>
<p class="block_2">???: “――It was unexpected that you did not take her life. Reconsideration: Required.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Suddenly, the voice of a third party interrupted Cecilus and Al’s conversation.</p>
<p class="block_2">Those who heard the voice faced towards it, and Cecilus slightly narrowed his eyes―― The owner of the voice was in the air, not in the midst of a jump, but in a state of simply floating there.</p>
<p class="block_2">For a moment, upon hearing the familiar manner of speech, Cecilus recalled the existence of the Witch whom he had once killed, but present there was not the same Witch in question――</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “――No, you’re the same person. You look different on the outside but you’re the same on the inside… Hmm? Perhaps you’re a little different on the inside too? Is such a thing even possible?”</p>
<p class="block_2">Witch: “If the form and nature of a soul changes, the exterior follows suit. The converse is also true, but… by what sort of principle were you able to perceive that with merely a single glance? Answer: Required.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “Hahahaha, now that you mention it, I too wonder how I figured that out.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Without any intentions to provoke her with teasing, and truly just not knowing why, Cecilus smiled.</p>
<p class="block_2">Only, for some reason he harbored confidence that such was the case at a single glance. That the woman floating in the air overhead, her white hair fluttering, was the same existence as that Witch.</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “But why are you here? Did you not learn your lesson when you were killed by me the first time, and came to get <i class="calibre4">houfuku</i><sup class="calibre5"><a class="calibre2" href="index_split_032.html#note_17" id="back_note_17" title="17">17</a></sup>? I find the appeal of such unyielding tough opponents to be desirable, but…”</p>
<p class="block_2">Witch: “To put it plainly, it is to carry out my objective. I have fulfilled one of my two overarching objectives. Once I achieve the one that remains, I hypothesize that I will be able to become fully absorbed in my original purpose of creation.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “Ho ho I see I don’t get it!”</p>
<p class="block_2">Witch: “I thought I had explained it succinctly, though. Explanation: Required.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “Well then how about I also give an answer that’s simple, unusually short, and succinct in terms of myself! ――If you came to where I was to fulfill your objective then you probably won’t be able to fulfill it.”</p>
<p class="block_2">It was plain and simple, exceedingly obvious, a clear answer unmatched in terms of being easy to understand.</p>
<p class="block_2">Hearing that response, the white-haired Witch narrowed her eyes, framed by long lashes, and nodded. And then――</p>
<p class="block_2">Witch: “Ah, is that so? In that case, my answer is simple. You cannot kill me.”</p>
<p class="block_2">Cecilus: “――――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Witch: “I have grasped that which is capable of killing me within this Empire. By no means shall I draw near any of them. Henceforth, nobody can kill me.”</p>
<p class="block_2">The Witch spoke in an indifferent manner, and raised both her hands to the sky.</p>
<p class="block_2">That instant, Cecilus felt a strange sensation that seemed to distort the air and space surrounding the Witch. Next to Cecilus, Al took a step forward.</p>
<p class="block_2">Since the Witch had made her entrance, Al had not spoken a single word.</p>
<p class="block_2">He looked up at the Witch, who continued to produce a strange air of oppression, and suddenly extended his single arm straight out to the side―― The next moment, the melted ground surged upwards, creating an unshapely stone <i class="calibre4">dao</i>, and Al gripped it in his outstretched hand.</p>
<p class="block_2">Raising the stone <i class="calibre4">dao</i> overhead, Al’s throat quaked towards the Witch――</p>
<p class="block_2">Witch: “I am the Witch of Greed――”</p>
<p class="block_2">Al: “――ECHIDNAAAAAAAA!!”</p>
<p class="block_2">With a voice of pure rage, akin to coughing up blood, he seemed to lose himself as he slashed towards her.</p>
